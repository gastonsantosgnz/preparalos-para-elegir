DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION
ABSTRACT
Many community colleges do not have a formal process in place to offer or support a structured
gap year option for students who recently graduated from high school, thereby denying those
students an educational option that has been recognized as beneficial to many learners. The
purpose of this qualitative study was to explore factors that influence students’ perceptions and
attitudes about the gap year choice so that community college administrators can better
understand how to structure and present the gap year as a viable educational option. Utilizing
case studies, the researcher conducted two semi-structured interviews via Zoom with each of the
study’s four participants during the Fall of 2023. Each participant was a current college
undergraduate student who had participated in a gap year sponsored by the college between
graduating high school and beginning their freshman year of college. The families of the
participants were actively involved in the decision to take a gap year, suggesting that gap year
education should extend beyond students to their parents. Self-development was the primary
objective for each of these students in opting for a gap year, suggesting the need for school
administrators to understand the underlying driving motivators of students taking a gap year
when structuring or supporting a gap year program. All participants and their families had prior
positive experiences with the sponsoring school, suggesting that school affiliation plays a role in
the perceived credibility of a gap year. School outreach was somewhat limited during the gap
year, suggesting possible opportunities for improvement. More studies are needed to expand the
body of research on this topic and to factor in how various socioeconomic and demographic
conditions may impact gap year program offerings at the community college level.

DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 1
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Chapter 1 Introduction
There was a time not so long ago when a young adult taking a year off of school to
backpack across Europe or write a screenplay was seen as wildly naïve and irresponsible, not to
mention an unproductive detour on the road to a successful education and career. Surely, a good
number of heated family arguments over the years have started with a son or daughter declaring
the need to take a year off to experience life and find themselves.
In reality, this phenomenon has been occurring in some fashion for centuries. Initially
dubbed as the “grand tour,” the earliest version of what has evolved into the modern day “gap
year” originated in seventeenth century Europe. Reserved primarily for the aristocratic elite,
British families sent their children off to travel the continent to gain greater cultural exposure,
refine their education, and experience life beyond their sheltered world (Gap 360, n.d.; Gap
Year Solutions, n.d.). Over time, a number of factors contributed to the diminishment of this
practice, including war as well as expanded travel opportunities that resulted from the building
of railroads. The modern version of the gap year emerged in the 1960’s, when elite
universities, including Cambridge and Oxford, required entrance exams that effectively
created a 9-month delay for students wishing to enter their institutions. A program of
structured activities for these students was aptly named GAP (Gap Activities Program), and a
new movement and catchphrase emerged (Gap Year Solutions, n.d.).
For many, though, the gap year was first introduced into the American lexicon in 2016
when the White House announced that First Daughter Malia Obama would be taking a gap
year prior to enrolling at Harvard University (The White House Office of the First Lady,
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 2
2016). Conversations about the legitimacy of a gap year resurfaced in 2020 as the COVID-19
pandemic threw a wrench into most in-person learning, prompting many students to reassess
their academic plans and explore an intentional break in their education. In the years that have
followed, the gap year choice continues to prompt debate online, in educational settings, and
around kitchen tables.
Since many parents and professionals came of age prior to its rise in popularity in the
United States, the merits of the gap year may often remain elusive and incorrectly shaped by
hearsay, conjecture, and a portrait painted by pop culture. In reality, many studies have
examined the experiences and benefits of students taking a gap year, and numerous colleges
and universities are now embracing the gap year as a viable juncture in the journey to a
successful higher education and career experience.
Often framed as an option for students from affluent families to travel and gain life
experience before going on to an elite university, it is not surprising that information and/or
research about the gap year phenomenon relative to community college students is scarce.
While a quick internet search of college gap year programs will yield results from a plethora
of institutions and programs, the same cannot be said of a search focused on community
colleges. Despite many top universities openly embracing and promoting the gap year,
community colleges seem to shy away from this option.
As higher education institutions continue to compete for a shrinking applicant pool,
community colleges are no exception. According to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau
(2021), in 2020, college enrollment in the United States fell to its lowest level since 2007,
with two-year colleges seeing their lowest enrollment levels in two decades. Additionally,
many teens are graduating from high school with little or no work experience, further limiting
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 3
their prior exposure to various career options when entering college. According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (Morisi, 2017), the labor force participation rate of teens ages 16-19 has
been on a decades-long downward trajectory since its peak of 57.9% in 1979, with particularly
dramatic drops seen in teens holding summer jobs. These trends among the younger
workforce were further accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some improvement
occurring as the pandemic waned. In July of 2022, during the height of summer employment,
55.3% of those age 16-24 were employed, up from 54.4% in July 2021, but still below the prepandemic level of 56.2% in July 2019 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). One might argue
that the lack of real-world work exposure experienced by potential incoming college freshmen
lends itself to the need for exploring the possibility of a gap year to gain a greater perspective
on personal skill sets and career interests.
At present, many community colleges seem to have failed to embrace the gap year as a
legitimate educational option for graduating high school students, offering little to no structure
or formality around this choice. The purpose of this study is to examine how a formal
approach to the gap year at a four-year institution might impact student perspectives about this
option, and how aspects of such a program can potentially be beneficial at the community
college level as well.
This chapter introduces the study’s research problem, including background
information about the need for the study and an introductory discussion of the context,
challenges, and possible solutions related to the research problem. The chapter articulates the
purpose of the study, the guiding research questions of the study, and the definitions and
assumptions that will guide the study. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the study’s
significance and a brief description of how the five-chapter research report is organized.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 4
Statement of the Research Problem
Research Problem
Many community colleges, including the audience for this research, Union Community
College (“UCC”), do not have a formal process in place to offer a gap year option for potential
incoming students who recently graduated high school, thereby denying these individuals an
educational choice that has been recognized as beneficial to many learners. Whether a student
chooses this community college due to its proximity to home, lower tuition costs, limited
academic alternatives, or simply because it’s the best fit for the student’s overall needs, having
the gap year option would help put UCC on par with other larger institutions. Additionally,
having a structured option for a gap year may attract students who would not have otherwise
considered attending college, thereby creating greater equity for all students and a possible boost
to enrollment.
While the gap year is often marketed to high-performing students, research indicates that
a broader audience can benefit from the gap year. In an Australian study of characteristics of gap
year students and their tertiary outcomes, students who deferred college enrollment were found
to have higher college marks than students who went directly to college after high school. The
impact was most apparent in typically low-performing students, particularly male (Birch &
Miller, 2007).
When considering the interests of the institution, without a formal program in place for
gap year students, the high school graduate who does not immediately enroll in community
college may be an untapped demographic who is not on the radar of college counselors. While
some community college administrators may view the gap year as a competing interest to those
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 5
in the college applicant pool, in reality, this option may help attract students who otherwise
would not have attended college and potentially aid in the retention of those who do.
What is a Gap Year?
While the timing, characteristics, and exact length of a gap year vary greatly around the
world, with no one definition seeming to be universally accepted, most definitions share more
commonalities than differences. According to the Gap Year Association, a non-profit gap year
program accreditation group whose mission is “to maximize the potential of young adults
through accessible and meaningful gap year opportunities (Gap Year Association, n.d.-a, para. 1-
3), each gap year is unique. However, this association of students, educators, schools, and
programs recognizes a gap year as “a semester or year of experiential learning, typically taken
after high school and prior to career or post-secondary education, in order to deepen one’s
practical, professional, and personal awareness” (Gap Year Association, n.d.-b, para. 1-2). For
the purpose of this study, gap year refers generally to “a period of time (usually an academic
year) taken by a student as a break from formal education, typically between leaving school and
starting a university or college course, and often spent travelling or working” (Oxford University
Press, n.d.). The specific criteria used for identifying gap year student subjects relative to this
study is discussed in detail in the methodology section.
Why Should Community Colleges Embrace the Gap Year?
While community colleges have long been seen as a refuge for returning students, little
has been done to engage with those students before and during a break in their education. Rather,
breaks in education for students prior to community college enrollment have largely been viewed
or assumed as unintentional pauses due to life circumstances. The absence of an intentional,
formalized gap year option for these students may be depriving them of a viable educational
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 6
path. By engaging with this audience in a more deliberate way, students choosing to take a gap
year may be put in a better position to access its benefits, such as gaining work experience
relative to career interests, volunteering, travel, or pursuing other interests aimed at gaining
valuable life experience. Additionally, it could prove to be beneficial to students who wish to
attend community college because they feel unprepared for the demands of college and
adulthood, as they may gain confidence and maturity through such experiences.
Student Satisfaction and Academic Performance
Just as any higher education institution does, community colleges strive to graduate
satisfied students and to successfully encourage strong academic performance from those
students. A recent study on the role of how validating support promotes college students’ major
and career self-efficacy (MCSE) notes that students with higher levels of MCSE are more likely
to put more effort into their coursework. Therefore, student support efforts by college educators
can play an important role in student success rates (Kitchen, 2021). This points to the need for
early and ongoing interaction with and support of students by college counsellors and educators
as students are deciding on a major and career path, regardless of whether they are actively
enrolled in college or taking time away to prepare for and assess such choices.
Trends in Colleges and Universities
Not only are several elite universities allowing for gap years, but they also actively
promote gap years in their marketing materials. Princeton University, for example, promotes the
Novogratz Bridge Year for all incoming first-year Princeton undergraduate students. According
to its website, the nine-month program fosters community engagement with participants living
with a host family in one of five international locations (Princeton University, n.d.). Likewise,
the website for Harvard College, the undergraduate liberal arts division of Harvard University,
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 7
encourages students to take a gap year, even speculating that their 98% graduation rate “is
perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college”
(Harvard College, n.d., para. 4). In fact, since the 1970s, Harvard University has led the way in
advocating for students to take a gap year prior to entrance. At the height of the lucrative dotcom boom when stories of young people making outrageous amounts of money in the tech startup world had many parents scrambling to get their children into the right pre-schools and on the
path to success, it was Harvard administrators who warned of the dangers of burnout and the
need to catch one’s breath instead of merely always reaching for future goals (Fitzsimmons et al.,
2000). In a 2000 New York Times piece (Fitzsimmons et al.), school representatives speculated
that the then 97% graduation rate of the school was perhaps a product of so many students taking
time off.
This trend throughout some of the nation’s most prestigious academic institutions reflects
the growing acceptance of the gap year as a legitimate and worthwhile educational option.
Further, as all institutions compete for students, the prevalence of the gap year option at some
institutions shines a light on the absence of this option at others. This is particularly glaring at the
community college level.
The Need for Structure Around Student Breaks
Many students take a gap year in order to recover from the perceived burnout of high
school academics, but that does not diminish the need for the gap year to be presented, managed,
and measured as a structured option. Whether a student engages in a gap year to travel,
volunteer, earn money, or simply disengage from the rigors of daily academic work, research has
found that a structured gap year with predetermined objectives facilitates personal growth and
the acquisition of new skills for gap year students (Rabie & Naidoo, 2016).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 8
Beyond benefiting individual students, a better understanding of this issue may benefit a
variety of education professionals, from community college enrollment and career services
representatives, to high school guidance counselors. Additionally, individuals who may have
input or influence on students’ decisions (e.g., parents) may also benefit from this research.
Challenges/Obstacles
When researching gap years, two major obstacles stand out. First, to suggest that the gap
year choice should exist for all is not to say that all should take a gap year. It is clear that this
path is not for everyone. An Australian study rooted in the life span of control theory found that
gap year students had higher university dropout rates compared to those who went straight to
university (Parker et al., 2015). What this and other studies acknowledge, though, is that it is
virtually impossible to account for every variable that may contribute to causality. In essence, it
is unclear whether these students had a propensity to drop out for other reasons that perhaps
delayed their studies. This again points to the very personal nature of the gap year decision and
the need for counseling and outreach to students who are considering this option.
Another challenge that exists relative to studying student perceptions of the gap year
includes how the views and opinions of other individuals—namely family members—tend to
shape a student’s own views. Cultural perceptions and practices relating to the gap year vary
widely around the globe. In Ireland, a quasi-gap year is offered midway through post-primary
school and is regarded by many teachers and parents as a positive experience. Despite no clear
differences having been reported on several measures, students who participated in this transition
year reported significantly higher increases in subjective age and, particularly amongst boys,
self-reliance (Clerkin, 2020).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 9
Whereas the gap year is widely accepted in many European cultures, a recent Russian
study (Kremen & Tsitsikashvili, 2021) about student perceptions of the gap year in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic, found that most students still would not consider a gap year even
during a worldwide pandemic. These feelings were attributed, at least in part, to the conservative
views of most Russian parents. A U.S. study of 9th graders (George Mwangi et al., 2019)
concluded that parental involvement creates a “college-going” cultural capital toward student
attainment of college milestones. Additionally, parental influence may be particularly
pronounced amongst certain demographics. For example, in a qualitative U.S. study focusing on
low-income, first-generation students, the role of parents/guardians was often cited as the top
motivational influence on a student’s decision to attend college (Mitchall & Jaeger, 2018).
For these reasons, student perceptions of their parents’ attitudes toward a gap year are
also noteworthy, as they present additional challenges and considerations relative to the
educational and communication process.
Success Stories/Solutions
Though the gap year option may not be suitable for every student, the benefits of a gap
year, or variations thereof, have been largely affirmed by students who have participated in them.
Iterations of a “gap” in education have been successful at the post-high school phase and beyond.
For example, one South African study (Nieman, 2013) found that all participants viewed their
gap year experience as constructive; this was particularly true for those who were initially unsure
of their career choice. The study focused on students’ own perceptions and reported several
benefits of the gap year, including recovering from academic burnout, readiness for university,
intercultural competence, greater independence and self-understanding, and feelings of maturity,
personal growth, and development (Nieman, 2013).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 10
A study in the United Kingdom that measured the value of deferring entry into medical
school found overwhelming support of the idea by students who themselves had taken a gap year
prior to medical school. Moreover, nearly half of non-gap year students also reported support for
the concept (Paterson-Brown et al., 2015). Regardless of the exact timing, a gap year appears to
be an appropriate tool for many students to prepare for the rigors of their next academic hurdle.
Research Purpose and Questions
Research Purpose
The purpose of this study is to explore factors that influence students’ perceptions
and attitudes about the gap year choice so that institution administrators (of UCC and
other community colleges) can better understand how to structure and present the gap
year as a viable educational option.
Research Questions
The guiding research question of this study is:
• How could a formal approach to the gap year option influence students’ perceptions and
attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between high school and community
college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
• How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and family
members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and disadvantages)?
• How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when the gap year choice includes
a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and career endeavors?
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 11
• How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when keeping them on task to
ultimately enroll in college is a component of the gap year?
Methodology
Using a qualitative approach, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with
four (4) participant undergraduate students currently attending Yardley College, a private college
in the Midwest, and who participated in a formal gap year program sponsored by the college
between high school and their freshman year of college. These case study discussions were
conducted through one-on-one video meetings between the researcher and each individual
participant.
Definitions and Assumptions
There are various definitions and assumptions used throughout this study. They include
the following:
Democratize: “To make (something) accessible to a wide range of people; to make
(something) less elitist, pretentious, etc.” (Oxford University Press, n.d.)
Gap year: “A period of time (usually an academic year) taken by a student as a break
from formal education, typically between leaving school and starting a university or college
course, and often spent travelling or working” (Oxford University Press, n.d.)
Significance of the Study
In recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic has reignited the gap year conversation,
many community colleges have actively spoken out against this option for students. A 2020
opinion piece from Community College Daily (Kapsner, 2020) highlighted five reasons to
choose community college over a gap year in light of COVID-19 travel restrictions and
uncertainty. The piece encouraged students to instead complete required general education
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 12
courses at a community college such as NorthWest Arkansas Community College who, in
turn, also featured the information largely unchanged on its website under the heading of
“Why Community College May Be a Better Alternative Than Gap Year During COVID-19”
(NorthWest Arkansas Community College, n.d.). Similarly, in a July 7, 2020, post on its
website, the Community College System of New Hampshire made arguments against the
traditional gap year. Instead, they advocated for students and families to “reimagine the gap
year” and suggested that going to community college instead of a residential university during
the pandemic could allow students to help their local communities while not stopping their
schooling (Community College System of New Hampshire, 2020). In essence, the school
appeared to be advocating for students who would otherwise go away to college to look at a
year of community college as offering many of the benefits of a traditional gap year through
local volunteerism rather than travel. While there seemed to be ample conversation around the
gap year in 2020 and beyond, there is a continued lack of scholarly research relative to the gap
year as it specifically relates to community college students.
It appears on the surface that community colleges are positioning the gap year as an
either/or proposition, failing to recognize that a properly structured gap year may actually
draw students—many who may have otherwise drifted—toward the college experience.
Additionally, by ruling in or ruling out career paths during a gap year, the offering could
promote better alignment between students and their selected major. For these reasons and
more, this topic needs to be explored as a potential correction to a current barrier to access for
community college students.
Chapter 1 Summary
This chapter provided an overview of the research topic: how a formalized approach to
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 13
the gap year at the community college level impacts student perceptions about the viability of
this choice. Chapter 2 will present a literature review, while Chapter 3 will describe the
methodology and methods that guided the study. Chapter 4 will report on and discuss the
study’s findings and results, and Chapter 5 will conclude the paper with a discussion of the
study’s implications on current practices, as well as recommendations for future research.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION
CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
Chapter 2 Introduction
According to a publication by the American Association of Community Colleges, a
central tenet of the United States community college system is access, meaning “all members of
a community—not just a select few—are afforded a pathway to attain a college education, be it
workforce training or through the pursuit of advanced degrees” (Mullin, 2017, p. 1). As such, it
stands to reason that programs and activities proven to be beneficial to college students must be
examined for their applicability at the community college level and, when deemed appropriate,
supported and advocated with comparable vigor to other academic options.
This study explored the following research question: How could a formal approach to the
gap year option influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable
option between high school and community college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and
family members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and
disadvantages)?
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes impacted when the gap year choice
includes a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and
career endeavors?
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 15
3. How does a plan to engage in ongoing outreach to students during the gap year
affect students’ perceptions and attitudes toward a gap year?
While much has been studied about virtually all aspects of the college-going experience,
scholarly literature related specifically to community colleges is somewhat limited and, in many
cases, dated. With nearly 7 million students enrolled in for-credit courses at over 1,000
community colleges across the U.S. (American Association of Community Colleges, n.d.), the
need for additional, intentional research focused on this population and the community college
setting is apparent. Likewise, gap year research specific to community colleges is essentially
non-existent. Therefore, for purposes of this literature review, older information was included
when considered relevant and necessary to provide the reader context and a better understanding
of relevant issues. Additionally, due to the lack of research on this issue, peripheral factors to this
choice were explored.
This chapter examines considerations when contemplating a gap year option at the
community college level, as it relates to institutional support and coordination via education,
communications, and outreach. It opens with a discussion of the worldview and theoretical
framework in which the research is grounded, followed by a literature review of the peripheral
issues to consider when answering the research question and sub-questions. Specifically, it
explores: 1) factors in choosing a community college, including financial considerations, major
and career uncertainty, prior academic performance, proximity to community and family,
parental influences, and quality of the institution; 2) the high school to college transition,
including academic preparedness, fear of the unknown, psychosocial factors, and dual enrollment
programs; 3) gap year benefits and considerations, including major and career clarity, socialemotional maturity, life experience and relationships, work experience impact, greater
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 16
motivation from a burnout break, and gap year drawbacks and considerations; and 4)
legitimizing the gap year option, including counselor significance, and parent education.
Constructivist Worldview and Constructivism Learning Theoretical Framework
This study was rooted in the foundation of the constructivist worldview and the
constructivist learning theory framework.
Constructivist Worldview
Grounded in the constructivist worldview, this study explored how a formal approach to
the gap year option influences students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable
option between high school and community college. The constructivist worldview takes a
philosophical approach to research that seeks to understand the subjective meanings individuals
place on their experiences (Creswell & Creswell, 2023). This broad worldview is the lens
through which research on the gap year was conducted. While the research question focuses
specifically on how a formal approach to the gap year option influences students’ perceptions
and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between high school and community college,
the underlying motivation for studying democratization of the gap year is the belief that the
breadth of experiences available to gap year participants is a rich educational tool that should be
accessible to all students. Consistent with that belief, the study is an example of critical action
research, reflecting an underlying commitment to ensuring fair and equitable educational
opportunities for all (Mertler, 2020).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 17
Constructivist Theory
Recognized as one of the “big ideas” within the realm of education, constructivist theory
“asserts that learning is an activity that is individual to the learner” and that these learners “will
try to make sense of all information that they perceive, and that each individual will, therefore,
’construct‘ their own meaning from that information” (Bada & Olusegun, 2015, p. 69). A central
tenet of constructivist learning theory, student-centered learning, demands that educators act as
facilitators and collaborators in relation to their students as they attempt to transform student
experiences into knowledge. This research focused on the role that educators—namely
community college counselors and academic advisors—play in student-centered learning,
achieved through a properly supported gap year option.
Factors in Choosing a Community College
In examining the community college population, much is written about the demographic
makeup of these students. Collectively, the group is predominantly female, is on average older, is
often enrolled on a part-time basis, and is as a plurality but not majority White (American
Association of Community Colleges, n.d.). While answering the “who” component, a deeper
dive into the “why” may be beneficial to better serve students. Understanding the underlying
motivating factors of students opting to enroll in community college could be an effective tool
for community college administrators to align offerings with student wants and needs, and to
position students for optimal academic outcomes.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 18
Financial Considerations
In a study of the parents of community college students, 97% of parents on the lower
socioeconomic end cited finances as a consideration in sending their child to a community
college (Bers & Galowich, 2002). The study utilized a survey tool which was completed by 225
parents and focused on the process of their child deciding to go to college and choosing a
specific institution; the study also contained essential demographic questions about the students
and families. A subsequent focus group of parents allowed researchers to obtain more in-depth
information about the participants’ children’s college search process, their parental perceptions
about their child’s college experience, and parent insight on the college catalog. The research
found that financial considerations as a factor in choosing a community college was not limited
to the poorest families. While socioeconomic standing was a factor for financially disadvantaged
participants, the overwhelming majority of all parents cited finances as a determining factor,
including 89% of parents in the middle economic status tier and 75% in the highest. Financial
consideration correlations were particularly pronounced amongst parents who assigned low
ratings to their child’s academic skills (Bers & Galowich, 2002). In a study further expanding on
these results (Bers, 2005), parents ranked the ability of students to juggle both work and school
as their top factor in deciding to enroll their student at a community college, suggesting that
financial considerations go beyond weighing the hard costs of tuition and housing. In fact, three
of the top four reasons in choosing a community college in this study involved finances,
including affordability and the student’s desire to save money (Bers, 2005).
Also examining factors impacting college choice, an analysis focusing on Latino students
(Kurlaender, 2006) found an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and community
college enrollment. The author examined a four-wave longitudinal study of eighth graders drawn
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 19
from a nationally representative sampling. The data collection, which began in 1988, used the
binary dependent variable of whether students attended a community college or a four-year
institution and used logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between the type of
post-secondary school attended and race, adjusting for a variety of factors. In general, students
from a higher socioeconomic status were less likely to attend community college, although this
was less pronounced amongst Latino students (Kurlaender, 2006).
Likewise, in a qualitative study of 49 Asian American community college students, the
most commonly referenced motivator in that decision was cost (Park & Assalone, 2019). In some
instances, paying for a four-year college was possible, just not practical. Some of these students
viewed the savings of a community college as an added perk, while others needed to work while
going to school or pay for college themselves. Regardless of the exact reason, financial
considerations were by far the most common driver of community college attendance (Park &
Assalone, 2019).
While financial considerations are likely to influence the decisions of many, if not most
students, matters of money appear to carry particular weight in the decision of those who opt to
attend a community college (Bers & Galowich, 2002; Bers, 2005; Kurlaender, 2006; Park &
Assalone, 2019).
Major and Career Uncertainty/Lack of Planning
Since the first two years of college is typically a time when students are fulfilling general
education requirements, community college may be viewed as an inexpensive way to explore
various academic and career choices with fewer interruptions to a student’s current life
circumstances. Opting for community college as a way to figure out those next steps relative to
education and career ranked in the top five reasons cited by parents for their children choosing a
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 20
community college, according to a 2005 Bers study which surveyed parents of high school
graduates who attended one of five suburban community colleges in a metropolitan area. In a
2022 survey of 500 recent high school graduates, only 24% felt “very” or “extremely” confident
in their educational or career path (Jaschik, 2022). In a 2019 qualitative study (Park & Assalone,
2019), interviews were conducted with 49 current Asian American community college students
and transfer students to three-year institutions in Southern California. The researchers concluded
that some students, feeling uncertain or unmotivated about their next steps, simply failed to apply
to a four-year school, thus ending up at a community college almost by default (Park &
Assalone, 2019).
Prior Academic Performance
The Kurlaender (2006) study also examined the role that prior academic performance
played in college selection and found that high-performing students tended to gravitate toward
enrollment at four-year institutions, while community colleges were a greater draw to lowerperforming students. Race, however, did play a factor in this study, with Latino students showing
a higher likelihood of attending community college regardless of their academic history
(Kurlaender, 2006). Authors Park and Assalone (2019) found that some students viewed
attending community college as part of a “strategy” or a “second chance” (p. 284-286). By
attending community college, students had the opportunity to make up for bad grades or less than
sufficient academic performance in high school to, hopefully, end up at their desired university.
While many high-performing students may be more likely to go to a four-year school,
some do attend community college and bring with them unique needs. A qualitative study of 10
academically advanced high school seniors who were identified for gifted services in their
district found that these students expressed specific interest in the career development aspects of
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 21
an institution, including job prospects post-graduation, acceptance rates to graduate programs,
and the opportunity for professional growth (Meyer & Cranmore, 2020). The authors concluded
with a call for equitable access to accurate and comprehensive information by school officials to
all students.
Students of all academic backgrounds face unique challenges in the college-choosing
process, from the frustration of limited pathways to the stress of multiple options. Recognizing
that community colleges serve as a point of access for students (Mullin, 2017) may place a
greater demand on community colleges to offer a broad range of academic programs and paths.
Proximity to Community and Family
In addition to academic, financial, and social pressures, one of the biggest fears facing
college-bound students is the prospect of being away from home (Shanley & Johnston, 2008).
Whether it’s missing parents or siblings, or simply longing for familiarity of one’s home and
surroundings, anxieties about being homesick are a real factor in the college choice process. The
2005 Bers findings ranked students’ desire to live at home as the second most prevalent reason
for choosing a community college.
Beyond merely missing friends, family, or significant others, other more practical matters
may come into play. Aside from the obvious financial savings of living at home, maintaining a
part-time job, or less expensive tuition, attending a community college may also be prompted by
one’s family obligations. For example, in a qualitative study of rural community college
students, one participant who had gotten pregnant and married a year after high school chose a
community college so that she could care for her child while enrolled in a radiology program that
would allow her to enter the workforce sooner (Strawn, 2019). This is just one of the many
personal anecdotes of how familial obligations steer students toward community college.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 22
In a book chapter covering the non-academic barriers facing rural community college
students, the authors noted that community colleges may also attract students who are facing
their own (or a family member’s) medical issues, based on the “open‐access mission of the
community college, coupled with the often flexible scheduling, smaller classroom environments,
and relatively no‐pressure admissions process” (Waters-Bailey et al., 2019, p. 83). Whether it’s
caring for a child, a parent, or oneself, community colleges have long been recognized as an
alternative for students with outside personal responsibilities.
Parental Influences
As anyone who has gone to college can attest, the process of preparing to attend a
community college or four-year institution begins long before classes commence. Not
surprisingly, research widely recognizes parents as a key influencer over their children’s
achievement of various milestones toward their journey to college. A study of 9th grade students
drawn from a national sample of over 900 schools found that parental involvement fosters a
college-going cultural capital amongst their children via the achievement of key college
readiness markers (George Mwangi et al., 2019). One may infer that, since many college
milestones occur long before entering college, influence by parents begins much earlier than the
transition period between high school and college.
Supporting the far-reaching role parents play for college-bound students, a cross-case
study of seven low-income, first-generation students rooted in self-determination theory
(Mitchall & Jaeger, 2018) found that “students’ self-determination was enhanced when parents
were involved in college planning, served as positive examples, set high academic standards
early, and fostered students’ sense of career volition” (p. 582). Conversely, student motivation
was negatively impacted by parental actions that ran contrary to these behaviors, such as when
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 23
parents limited choices, failed to set clear expectations and give feedback, and prioritized family
matters over education. Students in the 2018 (Mitchall & Jaeger) study often pointed to their
parents/guardians as the top motivational influence in their college decision. Other important
figures to the students were also cited as important influencers in college planning; this included
even extended family members. Participants acknowledged that their parents were not
necessarily knowledgeable about certain aspects of the college planning process but still viewed
them as sources of support, enhancing their feelings of competency and autonomy. While parents
did not dictate college planning choices, almost every participant reported that their parents
provided reassurance that they were “college material” (p. 594). Collectively, the research
strongly suggests that parents impact the college decision process of their children in a variety of
ways.
Quality of Institution
While community colleges offer a multitude of obvious advantages—such as
affordability and proximity to home—one should not assume that students disregard the quality
of an institution as a factor in attending a community college. In a study presenting 29 selection
variables, community college students ranked the overall quality of the education as their
primary consideration in choosing an institution, followed by the types of academic programs
available therein (Absher & Crawford, 1996).
Likewise, a 2022 qualitative study of dual enrollment students who ultimately enrolled in
their respective host community college after high school (Moore & Williams) attributed their
decision to several variables related to institutional quality. The case study, which utilized a
constructivist research paradigm, included six technical dual enrollment program students and
eight transfer dual enrollment students. Data gathering came from semi-structured interviews, a
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 24
document review, and field notes which included things such as behaviors and nonverbal cues.
The faculty, the learning environment, and the academic programs and transfer options were all
common themes cited by the students, suggesting that prior exposure to the quality of the
community college played a significant role in their decision to attend (Moore & Williams,
2022).
Summary of Factors in Choosing a Community College
In examining the factors that go into choosing a community college, it is clear that there
is typically no single driving force. Rather, a combination of variables, considered in their
totality but weighted based on individual circumstances, seems to be at the heart of embarking on
the community college path. While affordability is often a key consideration amongst both
students and their parents (Bers, 2005; Bers & Galowich, 2002; Kurlaender, 2006; Park &
Assalone, 2019) other factors can be equally or more influential. A lack of clear direction about
one’s major and career path (Bers, 2005; Park & Assalone, 2019) and/or student’s prior
academic performance (Kurlaender, 2006; Meyer & Cranmore, 2020) may play a role in the
decision to attend a community college. In other cases, the proximity to home lends itself to
students who aren’t prepared to leave home or who have work, family, or other personal
considerations (Bers, 2005; Shanley & Johnston, 2008; Strawn, 2019; Waters-Bailey et al.,
2019). While much attention is focused on the factors that impact student perspectives about this
issue, research suggests that parents often contribute a powerful voice in the college selection
process from both a financial perspective and beyond (Bers, 2005; Kurlaender, 2006; Mitchall &
Jaeger, 2018; George Mwangi et al., 2019). What should not be overlooked, however, is that
many students are drawn to a community college because of the quality of education they
perceive it can deliver. Whether students form first-hand impressions through specific programs,
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 25
such as dual credit enrollment, or they are influenced by the reputation or marketing of the
school, quality faculty, classroom environment, degree programs, and transfer ease are important
considerations to many students (Absher & Crawford, 1996; Moore & Williams, 2022).
High School to College Transition
In exploring the factors related to community college enrollment, it is appropriate to gain
a better understanding of what students who are contemplating their college options are
experiencing. Beyond the obvious need to factor in one’s academic preparedness in making
decisions about whether and where to attend, students in this transition period have the added
stress of contemplating how they will adjust to the rigorous academic demands of college and
how they will navigate the newfound personal independence that comes with being a college
student. Understanding psychosocial factors impacting a successful transition from high school
to college is important not only for students, but also for parents and college advisors and
counselors. Further, recognizing what personal traits are unlikely to change with intervention can
help ensure students are making choices that will allow them to succeed. In examining the high
school to college transition, it’s noteworthy that some students will have a unique perspective,
and arguably an advantage, due to their participation in a dual enrollment program.
Academic Preparedness
For some students, preparing academically for college may seem overwhelming. High
achieving students may find that their study habits in high school are not sufficient in a college
or university setting, while low performing students may face either the reality of not being able
to attend the college of their choice or the requirement to take remedial level courses. In an
online survey of students enrolled in a general education course at a Kentucky university,
academic preparedness was found to be a significant predictor of academic success, more so than
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 26
student perceptions of the institution’s commitment to their success or social integration, neither
of which had a statistically significant impact on the student’s course grade (Hepworth et al.,
2018). This suggests the need for intervention long before students are in the process of
transitioning to college.
A qualitative study at a large, public community college in the Southeast (Martin et al.,
2014) utilized semi-structured interviews with faculty, staff, and administrators to explore their
perceptions of factors that contribute to student success as well as the institution’s role in student
success. Based on former students who the college had identified as having overcome odds to
graduate, as well as referrals from those students, a random group of graduates were interviewed
to examine the characteristics, experiences, perceptions, and behaviors that may have played a
role in their success. The study found that students lacking academic preparedness—among other
things—were able to offset that deficiency through motivation, self-direction, and developing
new support systems. The authors concluded that a well-defined plan for college was the most
significant predictor of success (Martin et al., 2014). The study suggested that academic
obstacles are secondary to how students navigate them; through proper behaviors, academic
hurdles can be overcome.
Fear of the Unknown
The choice of whether and where to go to college is, arguably, one of the biggest
decisions in life. The added social pressures of making new friends and potentially leaving home
for the first time can be overwhelming to some students. A 13-year longitudinal study of
Canadian high school students examining the transition process from high school to college
(Larose et al., 2019) noted that the process “appears to begin in the minds of students well before
they set foot in college” (p.707). Warning that problems with the academic transition are
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 27
determinant of future academic issues, the authors suggested early intervention between high
schools and colleges with students to help clear up misconceptions and common fears, worries,
and anxieties about college. Somewhat surprisingly, the study found that social and emotional
adjustment issues in college had more to do with personal traits than with the actual
environmental changes of attending college (Larose et al., 2019). In essence, students who had
adjustment issues in high school carried those problems into college, while those students who
were well-adjusted in high school adjusted well to college.
Psychosocial Factors
While the transition between high school and college and subsequent academic outcomes
beyond can be significantly shaped by early and ongoing interventions by schools, the
psychosocial attributes of individual students may also be determinants as to how students will
navigate academic and lifestyle demands. In addition to meeting more rigorous academic
standards, contemplating whether or not to leave home to attend college brings with it an entire
set of new responsibilities and potential sources of anxiety. In short, the role that psychosocial
factors play in the high school to college transition can be profound.
In a 2017 meta-analysis examining the relationship between psychosocial factors and
community college student success (Fong et al.), the categories of motivation, self-perceptions,
attributions, self-regulation and anxiety were studied against community college persistence and
achievement. Findings of the work, which was informed by the motivational theory and college
persistence models, utilized statistical integration from past research and suggested that students’
motivation and self-perceptions were strong predictors of both their achievement and persistence.
Dual Enrollment Programs
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 28
Some students making decisions about college do so with the unique advantage of having
already gotten a small glimpse of the college experience through a dual enrollment program. In a
study of full-time freshmen at a Northeast Tennessee community college who had participated in
a dual enrollment program in high school, participants were less likely to take remediation and
nearly 2.5 times more likely to graduate in two years (Grubb et al., 2017). The study examined
the full population of 1,232 freshmen who enrolled in the fall semester of community college
after finishing high school and compared participants against non-participants in dual enrollment
programs. While the analysis did not examine the role that other variables (such as school
counseling interactions) may play with dual enrollment students who go on to enroll in a
community college, it seemed to suggest that the difficult time some students experience during
the high school to college transition may be mitigated by participation in a dual enrollment
program (Grubb et al., 2017). A 2022 article by Knox explored how high school students can
potentially save community colleges through dual enrollment programs. It asserted that dual
enrollment is no longer for a privileged few. Rather, it is now seen as a tool to drive
socioeconomic mobility by showing students from all backgrounds that they can succeed in
college. Often subsidized by state programs, tuition can be significantly discounted or even free
for many dual enrollment participants. The article emphasized that, while exposure to a college
campus can be beneficial in building student confidence and eventually getting them enrolled as
full-time students, building relationships with those students is key (Knox, 2022).
Summary of High School to College Transition
In examining the transition between high school and college, it is clear that some factors
impacting that period begin to take shape long before high school graduation. Research points to
academic preparedness as a key predictor of academic success (Hepworth et al., 2018; Martin et
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 29
al., 2014), which supports the assertion that students may benefit from earlier intervention by
school advisors and other personnel. Likewise, these individuals can help ease student fears
during the transition period by being an early, accessible source of factual information about the
college experience, whether that be relative to academic, financial, or social-emotional aspects of
the college experience (Larose et al., 2019). Additionally, since certain student psychosocial
traits are proven mitigants against academic obstacles in college (Fong et al., 2017), early
intervention efforts by advisors might be more effective if they work on developing and
strengthening these skills in students starting from a young age. Finally, some students will
approach the transitional period with the unique advantage of having already experienced a taste
of college academia through participation in a dual enrollment program in high school (Grubb et
al., 2017). In addition to knowing why students choose to attend community college, having a
better understanding of the high school to college transition period may be useful when
structuring and communicating about educational options at community colleges, such as a gap
year.
Gap Year Benefits and Considerations
While those unfamiliar with the gap year may be quick to tag it as a vacation or a break
from hard work, when structured and supported properly, a well-planned gap year may afford
participants with a wide range of deliverables, including greater major and career certainty,
enhanced social-emotional maturity, valuable work and life experiences, the formation of new
relationships, and enhanced motivation. While these benefits are often celebrated by gap year
participants, potential disadvantages should not be overlooked.
Major and Career Clarity
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 30
For many students, the gap year is an important tool in bringing clarity to choosing a
major and, ultimately, a career path. In a qualitative study of gap year participants in South
Africa, all 34 participants who were interviewed reported their gap year as constructive. This was
particularly true for those students who were motivated to take a gap year due to uncertainty over
their field of study and career aspirations (Nieman, 2013). Another qualitative study out of South
Africa (Rabie & Naidoo, 2016), which examined the experiences of 11 students who had taken a
gap year, found the most frequently cited reason for taking a gap year was career uncertainty.
Exposure to various occupational duties during the gap year appeared to resolve these
uncertainties by ruling in or ruling out specific career paths.
It is believed that gap year participants are better informed when making decisions
relative to their education and career, in part due to the self-reflection that takes place during the
experience (Heath, 2007). It is critical, though, that students maintain some level of interaction
with educators. In a 2021 review (Kitchen) of survey data collected from a larger longitudinal
study of 760 University of Nebraska students, those with high levels of validation from educators
were found to feel more confident in their ability to identify, prepare for, pursue, and engage in a
major and career path.
Social-Emotional Maturity
In addition to career clarity, findings in the Nieman study also revealed a sentiment by
gap year participants that the experience helped them better adjust to the demands of university
life by contributing to their perceived maturity, personal growth and development, independence,
and self-understanding (Nieman, 2013). Closely paralleling these findings, a United Kingdom
study of 23 students who had taken a pre-university gap year within the last five years found that
all participants suggested that the gap year was a watershed event between who they were in the
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 31
past and who they became post-gap. The study, which utilized unstructured interviews, found
that gap year participants cited improvements to their maturity, confidence, and/or independence
as a result of their gap year experience (King, 2010). Finding one’s identity is a common theme
throughout gap year literature.
Similar benefits were reported by participants in the qualitative study of 11 first year
South African students who had taken a gap year (Rabie & Naidoo, 2016). An improved sense of
self-confidence was reported by all participants. Consistent with the findings of the 2013 Nieman
and 2010 King studies, students lauded the gap year for enhancing their maturity, increasing their
independence, and encouraging acceptance of their individuality.
Life Experience & Relationships
For many students, going away to college may be an experience unlike any they have
ever had. With limited life experience, students may have a social circle that has remained
relatively unchanged since kindergarten with little exposure to other cultures or ways of life
beyond their local community. Amongst the many benefits of a gap year are the acquisition of
new life experiences and the formation of relationships.
Some gap year experiences put students on the fast-track to learning practical skills
(including managing finances or cooking) such as those reported by South African students in
the 2016 Rabie and Naidoo study. The students also reported more transformational experiences,
such as expanding their knowledge and perspective on life and learning a different language.
Students in another South African study reported increased awareness of different cultures and
ways of life and new diverse social relationships as a result of their gap year experiences
(Nieman, 2013). While not all gap year programs contain international travel components—and
study abroad programs do not necessarily need to be offered in conjunction with gap year
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 32
offerings—research suggests that study abroad is closely correlated with higher achievement of
academic outcomes. A recent study of students attending a two-year technical community
college in the United States Midwest found that academic outcomes (namely as measured by
degree or credential completion, transfer to a four-year institution, GPA, and credits passed)
were consistently better for those participants who studied abroad versus those who did not
(Whatley & Canché, 2022). Again, this research is not specific to the gap year but is arguably an
endorsement for international gap year paths.
Work Experience Impact
Beyond providing clarity to one’s choice of major or career, work experience such as
internships can be an important differentiator for students as they navigate through college and
into their career. Unlike tenure gaps that are unstructured, collegiate internship participation is
shown to have a positive impact on student grades, problem solving, teamwork, and
communication skills (Wesley Routon & Walker, 2019). This large national study, which
covered over 442,000 students from 619 institutions, noted that the positive impact of internships
diminished when the internship resulted in the student taking time away from college. However,
the study focused on students already in the process of attending college and did not specifically
study gap year students (Wesley Routon & Walker, 2019).
Greater Motivation from a Burnout Break
One argument that cynics of a gap year may assert is that students taking time off from
school simply lack motivation and just don’t want to go to school. To some extent, they couldn’t
be more on target. Gap year participants do, in fact, cite the desire to take a break from school as
an important factor in their decision and report being reenergized about school after the time
away from formal studies (Nieman, 2013).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 33
Two Australian studies of 2,502 high school students and another of 338 undergraduates,
(20% of whom had taken a gap year) found that low academic motivation and uncertainty
amongst high school students was predictive of taking a gap year, and doing so positively
predicted academic motivation amongst the undergraduates (Martin, 2010). A prior Australian
study analyzing data drawn from student files also found that gap years were most beneficial to
students with prior academic problems, concluding that “there may be merit in encouraging some
students to take a break between high school and university, particularly for students who are
expected to have below average performance at university and who are unsure of their future
directions (Birch & Miller, 2007, p. 341). These studies seem to dispel the notion by many that
gap years only stand to benefit top students headed for Ivy League universities.
Gap Year Drawbacks and Considerations
The benefits of a gap year are broadly supported across much of the literature, but that is
not to say that the gap year option does not come with its own set of risks and considerations.
Just as college may not be the right path for every student, the gap year may not be appropriate
for all students. Though research on the gap year is largely positive, research involving two
studies, one in Finland and another in Australia, was less favorable. Rooted in the life span
theory of control, the three-wave Finnish study of 636 students which measured students in their
last year of high school through ages 22-23, found no difference in “goal commitment, effort
expectations of attainment and strain, or in actual university enrollment in those planning to enter
university directly versus those who plan to take a gap-year” (Parker et al., 2015, p. 323).
Similarly, in the Australian longitudinal study of 2,228 participants, the same authors found no
differences in participant views on future and career or life satisfaction between those who had
and had not taken a gap year prior to university enrollment. However, in a rare finding of
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 34
negative outcomes associated with a gap year, the latter study also found that those taking a gap
year were more likely to drop out of their university degree program. The authors suggested that
more research was needed to determine whether these findings could be generalized to countries
where gap years are more prevalent (Parker et al., 2015).
Outside of some sporadic mentions by gap year participants of disadvantages such as a
year of lost income or lagging behind friends in school (Nieman, 2013), the biggest drawback to
a gap year seems to be the risk that it will not be productive or that students will not get back on
track with their education. In the absence of partnerships with colleges, “individual responsibility
is placed on young gappers to make their time out worthwhile and to stand out from the crowd”
(Snee, 2013, p. 843). Additionally, some students reported feeling disconnected and isolated
from family and friends, though this was also sometimes attributed to lack of planning and
structure around the gap year (Rabie & Naidoo, 2016). A well-planned gap year may be a
mitigating factor to such drawbacks.
While several organizations exist to help facilitate student gap years, students can
become lost in the shuffle and veer off course of their academic path without the support and
guidance of college personnel. A 2016 article (Barnds) stressed the importance of involvement
by school counselors, admissions representatives, and others to be a “source of reliable
information” to students considering a gap year so that it is a “year on rather than just a year off”
(p. 46). In a telephone conversation with the author (K. Barnds, personal communication,
January 20, 2023), he noted that the greatest risks to students who take a gap year involve
communications with the school they will ultimately attend. Since they aren’t planning to attend
the school immediately after high school, students often fail to make formal contact with the
school, and/or they choose a college that does not engage in formal outreach with gap year
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 35
students. Emphasizing the importance of a multi-year plan, he noted the need for ongoing
outreach and communication to keep gap year students on pace to successfully transition into
their college program after the gap year.
Summary of Gap Year Benefits and Considerations
The benefits of a gap year are far-reaching, from practical experiences that improve
academic outcomes and better direct students to the appropriate major and career , to helping
students find their own identity by enhancing social-emotional maturity, gaining valuable work
and life experiences, and developing new relationships (Heath, 2007; King, 2010; Nieman, 2013;
Rabie & Nadoo, 2016; Wesley Routon & Walker, 2019). Regardless of their academic
performance in high school, students can find themselves reinvigorated after a gap year, with
greater motivation from having taken a moment to catch their breath after many years of
classroom education (Birch & Miller, 2017, Martin, 2010, Nieman, 2013). Those considering
taking a gap year, though, need also understand potential drawbacks and other considerations,
namely the need for purpose and structure during this time by forging relationships with college
personnel who can ensure participants stay on track toward their ultimate educational path
(Barnds, 2016; Barnds, 2023; Nieman, 2013; Rabie & Naidoo, 2016; Snee, 2016). In short, many
students may likely benefit from a well-planned gap year under the direction and guidance of
their desired college.
Legitimizing the Gap Year Option
For some students and parents, one of the lingering concerns about the gap year option
may be the lack of knowledge and support on the matter by college personnel. Though academic
advisors, counselors, and other college administrators are charged with understanding and
communicating about the intricacies of a specific course or major, the same is not always true
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 36
regarding the gap year option. This lack of formality around the gap year option may be a
hindrance to students and parents when weighing the advantages of a gap year, as it is
presumably reasonable that students could veer off their academic path without a partnership and
ongoing interactions with the college they ultimately plan to attend.
Counselor Significance
As students in the latter half of high school begin to weigh various academic and/or
career paths, it may seem obvious that school guidance counselors and academic advisors from
both high schools and colleges will play a positive role in that process. However, a 1960 study,
which remains controversial still, called that assumption into question. Dubbed the “cooling-out”
(p. 569) process, Burton Clark asserted that the American higher education system actually
works to dissuade certain students from paths that are deemed to be out of their reach (Clark,
1960), even positing that one function of counseling is to “reduce aspiration” (p. 575). Better
known then as “junior colleges” (p. 569), Clark studied the role academic advisors within a
community college setting played in tempering the expectations of students believed to be on too
ambitious a career path. Not surprisingly, this landmark study is still referenced today, as it runs
counter to conventional wisdom that academic advising is a critical factor in student success.
Over the following decades, many studies set out to test such assertions. A large study of
first-time freshmen enrolled in 1995 in any one of California’s 107 community colleges (Bahr,
2008) examined the effect of advising on student success and whether the attainment of such
goals was dependent on a number of factors, including academic preparation of the students and
race/ethnicity. The two cohorts studied included a group of students who intended to transfer to a
4-year college and another group of remedial math students, and the study examined advising
administered to both the perceived high and low-performer student sub-groups. Findings of the
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 37
study failed to support Burton’s “cooling out” assertion. Contrary to the Burton study, Bahr’s
work supported the belief that community college advising is, in fact, beneficial to student
success. Further, students who were faced with greater educational challenges—in that they were
deemed less prepared or had the poorest skills—appeared to benefit the most from advisor
intervention (Bahr, 2008).
In exploring the role that community college advisors play in the academic success of
students, both the Bahr study and a study of 397 Latino/a students in their second semester or
beyond (Tovar, 2015) looked at race/ethnicity as a potential factor in student success. In the
latter, which took place at an urban California community college, the study found a small but
significant benefit to Latino/a student success. Namely, GPA was correlated to the number and
nature of interactions students had with both advisors and instructors. Further, career discussions
with students had positive correlations with student success, whereas the lack of such
conversations had a negative effect. Findings also lent themselves to the belief that interactions
between students and school instructors and advisors must be of a purposeful and outcomesoriented nature to yield such benefits. Likewise, participation in a program rooted in counselor
support and an academically challenging program also influenced students’ success and intent to
complete their degree.
In addition to reinforcing the relevance of transition-to-college experiences, background,
and social and academic factors, Tovar’s study pointed to the importance of college advisors
serving as a trusted source for communicating information related to college from an academic,
career, and even social standpoint (Tovar, 2015). However, research supports that not all forms
of student outreach initiatives are created equally. For example, a study examining the effects of
pro-active success coaching to students based on predictive analytics derived from a student
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 38
monitoring system (Hall et al., 2021) generally found that the offer of intervention did not yield
higher GPA outcomes and had no effect on student persistence to complete their degree.
However, a 2022 (Fay et al.) mixed methods study utilizing interviews and a transcript review of
community college students and comparing students who received personalized advising
regarding transfer, versus those who received standard advisement services, illustrated a critical
aspect of advisement on student success. The study found that students who received
personalized advisement services and established relationships with their advisors transferred at
a higher rate than those who received typical, run-of-the-mill services.
Research also suggests that the number and nature of tactical duties that counselors and
advisors perform relative to student course registration may also be a factor in student success. A
study of the course enrollment behaviors of community college students (Gurantz, 2015) found
that varying degrees of procrastination and intensity relative to course registration were
predictive of student course enrollment patterns. When such behavior results in skipping courses
or entire terms, students may experience negative success outcomes. In a study of students from
five community colleges across one state, positive associations were found between enrollment
continuity and earning a credential, and between enrollment intensity and likelihood of transfer
(Crosta, 2014). Findings from such studies may lend themselves to the need for community
college advisors to play an active role in the student enrollment and course registration process
and to engage in ongoing relationships with students on such issues to best position students for
optimal outcomes.
Parental Education
Literature affirms the influence parents play in the college-related decisions of their
children. This, coupled with the fact that many parents pay for some or all of their children’s
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 39
college education, raises the question of parents’ expectations about communication and
education on various choices relative to their children’s college experience. A study that utilized
surveys and focus groups to explore the role of parents in their children’s choice to attend a
community college found that roughly 60% of parents reported that they, not their children, had
the initial idea of the child attending community college (Bers & Galowich, 2002). Further,
parents felt strongly that they should have more involvement in their child’s advising and
registration processes, be more informed on their child’s academic progress, and be offered a
parental orientation program. In general, participants in the study wanted to be more connected
with the college and receive more information, suggesting that ongoing parental education and
outreach by community colleges is an important aspect of how families navigate a child’s
educational experience.
Summary of Legitimizing the Gap Year
Collectively, studies of community college students seem to suggest that students are best
served when college advisors engage with them in meaningful, personalized ways on an ongoing
basis (Bahr, 2008; Fay et al., 2022; Tovar, 2015). From these studies, one might infer that, when
an advisor is seen as a trusted partner in the educational process, early and ongoing intervention
around structured options and practices will best position students for success. Research also
advances the notion that parents of community college students often play an active and
meaningful role in the educational decisions of their children (Bers & Galowich, 2002),
suggesting that institutions should strive to achieve parental buy-in about the academic path their
college-bound students may select.
Since both students and parents turn to trusted school officials when weighing college
options, the gap year choice may be best legitimized as a viable option through early and
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 40
ongoing education and outreach to students and parents. Further, having a well-planned path for
gap year students, which includes ongoing communication and support, is likely to alleviate
student and parental concerns about taking a gap year, thus allowing individuals to assess the
pros and cons of the gap year choice on its merits and with the confidence that it is, in fact, a
viable academic option.
Summary of the Literature Review
In exploring the potential need for a formal gap year option at the community college
level, it is important to better understand why students choose to attend a community college,
what that transition between high school and college looks like, and the potential benefits of a
gap year experience for some students.
Assuming that a gap year option at the community college level is warranted, it is critical
to better understand the role that school representatives, namely advisors, play in educating both
students and parents. Gap years may not be appropriate for every student. Early and ongoing
interactions with potential participants will ensure that the decision of whether or not to take a
gap year is given the weight it deserves. Further, ongoing communication and outreach by the
institution will best position students for maximizing the benefits of a gap year and mitigating
the risk of a student veering off their academic course. In an article for the Journal of College
Admission, the director of the Gap Year Association, Ethan Knight, noted the importance of
students working with college admissions representatives throughout their gap year, yet he also
reports that 60% of students self-structure their own gap year (Knight, 2018). The Rabie and
Naidoo (2016) study concluded that “engaging in a structured gap year with predetermined
objectives provided a conducive context for the participants’ personal growth and the acquisition
of a variety of skills” (p. 153).
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 41
While many organizations work with students on structuring a gap year, the primary
determinant in the success of participants appears to be involvement of the college with the
student. Outreach efforts may include providing information from school advisors to gap year
students, obtaining a statement of purpose from potential gappers, appointing a school
representative to work with gap year students, providing an enrollment checklist to keep students
on pace for admission following their gap, and engaging in ongoing communications to keep gap
year participants engaged and feeling part of their college community (Barnds, 2016, p. 44).
These, of course, are merely the viewpoints of one source but may highlight a general approach
to creating a formal structure around the gap year option.
Chapter 2 Summary
Chapter 2 provided an overview of literature related to the study’s research topic. The
guiding research question of this study was: How could a formal approach to the gap year option
influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between high
school and community college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and
family members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and
disadvantages)?
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes impacted when the gap year choice
includes a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and
career endeavors?
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 42
3. How does a plan to engage in ongoing outreach to students during the gap year
affect students’ perceptions and attitudes toward a gap year?
Chapter 2 specifically explored 1) factors in choosing a community college, including
financial considerations, major and career uncertainty, prior academic performance, proximity to
community and family, parental influences, and quality of the institution; 2) the high school to
college transition, including academic preparedness, fear of the unknown, psychosocial factors,
and dual enrollment programs; 3) gap year benefits and considerations, including major and
career clarity, social-emotional maturity, life experience and relationships, work experience
impact, and greater motivation from a burnout break, as well as gap year drawbacks and
considerations; and 4) legitimizing the gap year option, including counselor significance and
parent education. Chapter 3 describes the methodology and methods which guided the study.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND METHODS
Chapter 3 Introduction
Research Purpose
The purpose of this study was to explore factors that influence students’
perceptions and attitudes about the gap year choice so that institution administrators (of
UCC and other community colleges) can better understand how to structure and present it
as a viable educational option.
Research Questions
This study explored the following research question: How could a formal approach to the
gap year option influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable
option between high school and community college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating
students and family members on the gap year option (including its
potential advantages and disadvantages)?
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 44
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes impacted when the gap year
choice includes a structured path aimed at better preparing students for
educational and career endeavors?
3. How does a plan to engage in ongoing outreach to students during the gap
year affect students’ perceptions and attitudes toward a gap year?
Chapter 3 explores the research methodology and methods used to answer the research
question by reviewing: 1) the definitions, advantages/disadvantages, and justification of use for
the qualitative methodology, action research, and a case study research approach, as well as the
research context and setting, 2) the participant recruitment and selection process, specifically
examining participants, recruitment and selection, and researcher positionality, and 3) research
methods, specifically examining data collection and analysis.
Research Methodology
Grounded in the constructivist worldview and utilizing a qualitative methodology, this
action research study explored how a formal approach to the gap year option could influence
students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between completion of
high school and enrollment in community college. The constructivist worldview takes a
philosophical approach to research that seeks to understand the subjective meanings individuals
place on their experiences (Creswell & Creswell, 2023). It is built off the assumption that all
living creatures have experiences, which humans seek to access, and that the totality of those
interconnected experiences becomes the overall summative experience (Liu, 2022). According to
Liu (2022, p. 276), the constructivist worldview, “divides all features in the world into purported
external properties and the totality of experience and argues that they are all constructed.” In
practical application, researchers ground their work in the constructivist worldview by starting
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 45
with a broad question and allowing participants to guide the data collection process as the
researcher strives to understand the viewpoints and perceived realities of each participant’s
experience (Thompson, 2018). This approach is closely mirrored by the researcher in this study,
as a broad, guiding research question sought to better understand the experiences of gap year
participants by allowing them to drive the data collection process toward discovering and
articulating their own perceived truths.
Qualitative Methodology
Creswell and Creswell (2023) define qualitative research as “an approach for exploring
and understanding the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem” (p.
5). As a research methodology, the qualitative approach seeks to explain why people feel or
believe certain things and how that ultimately impacts their behavior (Sutton & Austin, 2015).
Qualitative research provides practical tools to address individual and social situations
and problems in an empirical way, potentially shedding light on what impacts underlying
statistical correlations and explaining why certain behaviors occur (Cornejo et al., 2023; Forman
et al., 2008; Sutton & Austin, 2015). Additional advantages of qualitative research include that it
uses subjective processes and meanings that are constructed by people and groups of people; it
offers epistemological approaches to respond to multidimensional social issues; and it can give a
voice to underrepresented groups by studying the vulnerabilities of specific underrepresented
populations (Cornejo et al., 2023; Forman et al., 2008).
Among the perceived disadvantages of qualitative research are that data analysis is
largely inductive and interpretive, and ensuring rigor can be difficult—particularly if a researcher
is not highly skilled (Forman et al., 2008). Further, qualitative research can create large amounts
of data for the researcher to sift through and analyze, and unforeseen variables, such as the
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 46
COVID-19 pandemic, can greatly impact the process (Cornejo et al., 2023; Sutton & Austin,
2015).
The researcher believes that the qualitative methodology was the correct approach to this
study. The gap year phenomenon is deeply personal in that the experience of each individual
who undertakes such an endeavor must be studied in great depth; this is necessary in order to
truly understand the impact and consequences of the gap year experience on each individual’s
life. Qualitative research methods “have a common goal of understanding, rather than measuring,
phenomena” (p.765) through an iterative, not sequential process (Forman et al., 2008).
Action Research
This study utilized action research, which can be defined as meta-practice, practitionerbased research, which uses cyclical modeling whereby there is action; reflection on that action is
ongoing throughout the research process (Godfrey, 2020). The goal of action research is to
improve a situation. Action research can involve methods such as interviews, observation, and
questionnaires (Godfrey, 2020). Specifically, this study was an example of critical action
research, reflecting an underlying commitment to ensuring fair and equitable educational
opportunities for all (Mertler, 2020).
Action research offers practical solutions to problems in the classroom and raises
knowledge and awareness amongst teachers, in turn allowing them to be more pragmatic,
collaborative, and adaptive. Other advantages are that it encourages professional development
while finding solutions to real-world problems and allows teachers to conduct research in an
environment where variables are more controlled (Messikh, 2020).
While action research is growing in acceptance, perceived credibility issues and the
potential for an inherent bias when the researcher is part of the population being studied remain
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 47
notable disadvantages of action research (DeOliveira, 2023; Messikh, 2023). The researcher
believes that action research is appropriate in this study, as some form of intervention is
contemplated and will, ideally, lead to a solution for the setting (Herr & Anderson, 2015).
Case Study Research Approach
This qualitative action research study utilized case studies, via semi-structured
interviews, to aid in answering the research question. While many definitions exist for a case
study, it is generally viewed as a specific research design that uses an empirical inquiry to
investigate a cultural phenomenon within a “bounded system,” which could be made up of
individuals, a group, a family, a class, and so on (Kekeya, 2021, p. 28).
According to Kekeya (2021), case studies can shed light on the complex interactions
amongst humans within the context of their everyday lives and experiences. In some instances,
the findings can be transferred to other settings to help readers better understand their own
personal experiences. Case studies comingle descriptions of particular events with analysis and
can sometimes be utilized by entities, such as governmental departments, for policy and process
improvement.
The main advantages of doing case study interviews—specifically via videoconference
interviews, as was utilized in this study—include affordability for the researchers and
participants (reduced travel expenses), greater accessibility than in-person interviews (accessing
transnational participants), and protecting personal space, privacy, and safety through social
distancing (Khan & MacEachen, 2022).
Limitations of case studies include limited generalizability to larger groups, biased
interpretation or manipulation of the data by the researcher, long and time-consuming data
analysis, and untrue or exaggerated information reported by participants (Kekeya, 2021). The
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 48
main disadvantages of doing case study interviews specifically via videoconference interviews
include practical challenges such as: dropped calls and other technology problems, difficulty in
reading body language, and a loss of intimacy as compared to in-person interviews (Khan &
MacEachen, 2022).
Further, whereas Khan and MacEachen (2022) were relatively dismissive of the notion
that videoconferencing tools present unique ethical considerations for qualitative interviews,
Roberts et al., (2021) placed greater significance on that difference. In fact, the latter went so far
as to suggest that using a virtual tool to conduct interviews changes the dynamics of the entire
process. For example, they noted that the many emails that researchers and participants often
exchange just to arrange for the meetings can help foster rapport, while the digital divide can
create issues of equity with participants (Roberts et al., 2021).
The researcher believes that the case study research design, specifically utilizing
videoconferencing, was the correct approach to this study because the personal nature of a gap
year experience requires an intense examination at the individual level. When considering that
the participants were all current college undergraduates who presumably are well-versed in
videoconferencing, the researcher felt comfortable that this non-invasive, ubiquitous form of
communication would best position the interviews for success.
Research Context
Research Setting
According to information set forth by the school, Yardley College is an academically
robust liberal arts college in a suburban Midwestern setting. Rooted in Christianity, the school is
known for both its academic rigor and commitment to strengthening the faith of its students. The
diverse population of 2,300 undergraduate and 600 graduate students represents every state in the
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 49
nation, as well as 39 countries. Beyond academic ability, per the institution’s recruitment
materials, Yardley College places great weight on the personal attributes of applicants and seeks
those with moral character, strong faith, social concern, and personal integrity.
Participant Recruitment and Selection
Participants
In total, four participants were included in this study. The relatively small sample size
was chosen to facilitate a primary goal of the project, which was to research deeply rather than
widely. As was outlined in the Information and Consent materials, in order to participate,
individuals had to meet the following criteria: 1) be at least 18 years of age; 2) be currently
enrolled as an undergraduate student at Yardley College; and 3) have participated in Yardley
College’s Guardian Gap Year Program between a student’s high school graduation and freshman
year of college.
Recruitment and Selection
The researcher worked with a school official, the director of the Guardian Gap Year
Program at Yardley College, to identify currently enrolled undergraduate students who had
participated in Yardley College’s Guardian Gap Year Program between high school graduation
and their freshman year of college. The director of the gap year program at Yardley College
provided the initial outreach to eligible former participants of the Guardian Gap Year Program
via email, with a link to the researcher’s Invitation to Participate and Information and Consent
Form.
Recruitment efforts ceased once four candidates who met the requirements for inclusion
were identified and committed to participation. Candidates were not considered participants until
the Information and Consent Form was signed and received back by the researcher. Completed
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 50
forms could be returned either directly to the researcher or to the Guardian Gap Year Program
director who did the initial outreach for recruitment, as long as completed forms were ultimately
forwarded to the researcher. Forms were given to the researcher via email and, once received by
the researcher, were retained electronically on the researcher’s password-protected personal
computer. Completed forms were also retained on a flash drive and in hard copy form in a binder
at the personal residence of the researcher.
No inducements, extra credit, rewards, or compensation were offered by the researcher in
exchange for participation in this study. However, the researcher asserted that participants would
gain valuable exposure to the research process and doctoral work, potentially sparking an interest
in, or satisfying curiosity about, graduate studies. Not only did participants have an opportunity
to self-reflect on their own gap year experience, but they also had the satisfaction of knowing
that they helped shape the field of education through participation in scholarly research. Further,
as participants perhaps attempt to obtain admission to a graduate program and/or a job,
participation in a doctoral study will be an activity on their resume that is not entirely common.
As was communicated in the Information and Consent materials, taking part in this study
was voluntary. Potential participants were instructed that they could choose not to take part in
this study, or, if they did choose to participate, they could leave the study at any time.
Participants did not need to answer any question they did not wish to answer, and there was no
penalty for withdrawing from this study.
Researcher Positionality
Herr and Anderson (2015) noted that, within action research, the positionality of the
researcher can be either that of an insider or an outsider. Researcher positionality is significant
because it ultimately shapes the researcher’s views about “power relations, research ethics, and
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 51
the validity or trustworthiness of the study’s findings” (p. 3). The researcher was an outsider
within the context of this study and was not employed by or affiliated with Yardley College in
any way. The research setting was chosen after learning of and researching the gap year program
offered by Yardley College. While the researcher was familiar with the setting, there was no
specific relationship or affiliation with this school.
Research Methods
Data Collection
During the fall of 2023, the researcher conducted two semi-structured interview sessions
with each of the four participants. A semi-structured interview is one “where the researcher asks
several ‘base’ questions but also has the option of following up a given question with
supplementary or exploratory questions, depending on the participant’s response” (Mertler,
2020, p. 314). Since the researcher was seeking information on personal experiences that could
require additional clarification or feedback, the open-ended nature of the semi-structured
interview approach allowed for greater depth and probing in the data collection process. Semistructured or open-ended formats are considered best for “truly qualitative data” collection
(Mertler, 2020, p. 134), which was utilized in this research.
The first interview focused on how the individual was first introduced to a gap year,
initial impressions, and family dynamics surrounding that decision. The second interview
focused on the gap year decision as it relates to educational and career objectives, the role that
educator support and communication played in the gap year decision, and overall feelings about
the gap year experience. Since the researcher was an outsider, establishing rapport with
participants early in the process was key. In this instance, Herr and Anderson (2015) noted that
“a careful negotiating and establishing of trusted relationships is probably the key ingredient in
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 52
building a research endeavor that works for all involved” (p. 104). Since the participants in this
research were college students who grew up in an era where online communications are
ubiquitous, the researcher believed it was highly probable that a positive, trusting relationship
could be established via a remote interview process.
According to Muthanna and Alduais (2023), in qualitative research, the researcher
collects in-depth data from participants by conducting interviews with those individuals,
whereby the researcher tries to establish rapport and make the interviewee feel comfortable about
sharing their experiences about a topic. To do this successfully, researchers develop interview
guides, utilize reflexivity, show sensitivity, and act with integrity. Some topics can be sensitive
to the participant; as such, qualitative research requires a skilled researcher to respond to those
moments. Just as they noted that reflexivity enhances the trustworthiness by advancing research
ethics and integrity, Sutton and Austin (2015) took that a step further and stated that “bias and
subjectivity are not inherently negative but they are unavoidable; as a result, it is best that they be
articulated up-front in a manner that is clear and coherent for readers” (p. 226). With this in
mind, the researcher explained to participants her lack of experience within the realm of
education in order to be upfront about her shortcomings and help to build trust and rapport.
As was communicated in the Information and Consent form, the researcher conducted
these interviews via videoconferencing technology, with interviews being conducted, recorded
and transcribed via Zoom. Videoconference interviewing is described as non-face-to-face
interviews that utilize videoconferencing tools such as Skype, Zoom, and WhatsApp for
individual or group discussions, ethnography, and voice-based interviews/discussions (Khan &
MacEachen, 2022). Other forms of electronic communications, such as email and text, were
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 53
utilized for purposes of scheduling and general communication that needed to occur between the
researcher and participants.
The decision to conduct interviews via videoconferencing was driven by several
considerations, including: 1) concerns that another outbreak of COVID-19 could derail in-person
meetings, 2) time and travel associated with in-person interviews, 3) ease of recording and
transcribing contacts via Zoom, 4) participant ease, convenience, and perhaps greater willingness
to participate, and 5) the rising acceptance of remote data collection in qualitative research.
To ensure internal validity, the researcher employed strategies set forth by Creswell and Creswell
(2023) where appropriate. The primary strategies utilized were member checking and
clarification of researcher bias. It should be noted that, while Zoom recording and transcribing
features were utilized, the researcher ensured that transcriptions accurately reflected
conversations. This occurred by watching and comparing the recorded videos against the autogenerated transcriptions and making adjustments/corrections where necessary. Member checking
“is a technique for exploring the credibility of results. Data or results are returned to participants
to check for accuracy and resonance with their experiences” (Birt et al., 2016, p. 1802). Member
checking was used with all participants viewing and approving full written transcriptions. This
helped ensure that the data was accurately transcribed and gave the participants another
opportunity to interact with the researcher and offer any clarifications or concerns.
The researcher attempted to not only capture the sentiments of each individual participant
but also to identify themes across participants. The researcher employed several strategies to
minimize the potential for researcher bias. This form of bias occurs when “researchers
unknowingly interpret data to meet their hypothesis or include only data that they think are
relevant” or ask questions in a way to solicit a certain response (Shah, 2019, para. 6). To manage
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 54
this issue, the researcher carefully constructed and reviewed both the content of interview
questions and how those questions were presented, to ensure that they were not designed or
delivered in a way that solicited a particular response. Interview takeaways were presented in a
narrative case study format for each participant and collectively, where applicable. When
appropriate, findings were compared to existing research to highlight a correlation or lack
thereof.
To protect the privacy of the participants involved in this research as well as for the
specific institution, pseudonyms were assigned in place of actual student names. Only the
researcher had access to the data collected; data was stored on a password-protected computer
and flash drive and, in the case of physical materials, in the personal residence of the researcher.
All hand-written notes, files, flash drives, and recordings will be shredded/deleted once the final
scholarly manuscript is approved.
Data Analysis
In describing the steps involved in action research, Mertler (2020) outlined four stages:
planning, acting, developing, and reflecting. In the acting stage, data is collected and then
analyzed. In this study, data was collected during the fall 2023 school semester. Once interviews
were completed, transcribed, and subsequently verified for accuracy, official, robust data
analysis began. The preliminary identification and analysis of themes was prevalent even during
the initial data collection process but took on a more methodological complexion during this
step.
Labeled in recent research as “iterative thematic inquiry,” this approach centers on
themes from the very onset of the research and throughout (Morgan & Nica, 2020). Consistent
with a deductive reasoning approach, the authors suggested that themes help to highlight the
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 55
preconceived notions of the researcher and create a template for stating results throughout the
research. Deductive reasoning is a “top-down approach to reasoning, working from the general
to the more specific” (Mertler, 2020, p. 310). Rather than waiting until data collection is over and
results are being coded, this approach asserts that the process of identifying themes upfront is
what helps to create the analysis of findings. The four stages of iterative thematic inquiry are
“assessing beliefs; building new beliefs through encounters with data; listing tentative themes;
and, evaluating themes through coding” (Morgan & Nica, 2020, p. 2). This study followed a very
similar blueprint, with the researcher first assessing current personal beliefs, then processing data
as it was encountered to shape those beliefs. With identification and preliminary analysis of
themes occurring throughout the research, the researcher utilized an iterative process.
Throughout the process, the researcher used coding to analyze data. Coding is “the
process of labeling and organizing your qualitative data to identify different themes and the
relationships between them” (Medelyan, n.d. para. 5). The researcher identified and organized
common words, phrases, and topics from participant transcripts to capture themes within the
data; an Excel spreadsheet was utilized. The approach to this process was a hierarchical structure
similar to an organizational flow chart, with the largest concepts at the top and the supporting
positive and negative inputs cascading down. For example, a large concept was a focus on the
reasons why students take a gap year. Within this broader category, parental influences were
examined and, subsequently, the impact of parental education and information about the gap year
on the gap year decision. Deductive reasoning was used to establish connections and
commonalities between data points. Deductive reasoning “means you start with a predefined set
of codes, then assign those codes to the new qualitative data” (Medelyan, n.d., para. 25). In this
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 56
instance, the researcher started with specific concepts about the gap year in mind and assigned
aspects of participant feedback accordingly.
Additionally, while the researcher utilized a formal member checking process when data
transcription was finalized, some member checking occurred informally throughout the
interviews to ensure information was being fully and correctly understood by the researcher. For
example, in several instances, the researcher paraphrased back to the interviewee what had just
been communicated. From a more formal position, the researcher reviewed the interviews and
transcripts of participants and used Excel to analyze participant responses according to common
themes. This information was grouped and compared against existing research in order to
identify patterns that supported or contrasted the research or introduced new concepts.
Herr and Anderson (2015) noted that, while narrative writing about local practices is
useful and possibly even transferable, action research projects of this nature should also
demonstrate how this research fits into a more meta view and contributes to the broader research
on the topic. In the instance of this study, the researcher sought to transfer findings at this fouryear institution to a community college setting. That made this broader perspective even more
critical, as the setting at hand was not the ultimate audience of this research.
Chapter 3 Summary
Chapter 3 explored the research methodology and methods used to answer the research
question by reviewing: 1) the definitions, advantages/disadvantages, and justification of use for
the qualitative methodology, action research, and a case study research approach, as well as the
research context and setting, 2) the participant recruitment and selection process, specifically
examining participants, recruitment and selection, and researcher positionality, and 3) research
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 57
methods, specifically examining data collection and analysis. Chapter 4 reports and discusses the
study’s findings/results.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION
CHAPTER 4
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Chapter 4 Introduction
Chapter 4 explores the findings/results of two semi-structured qualitative interviews
conducted during the fall of 2023 with each of the four study participants. The interviews
explored individual perceptions and attitudes of the participants regarding their personal gap year
experience.
The guiding research question of this study was: How could a formal approach to the gap
year option influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option
between high school and community college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and family
members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and disadvantages)?
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when the gap year choice includes
a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and career endeavors?
3. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when keeping them on task to
ultimately enroll in college is a component of the gap year?
Findings
Anthony
Adopted from China at the age of two, Anthony grew up in a small town on the west
coast of the United States with three older sisters, biological to his parents, and one younger
sister who was also adopted from China. Pushed by his parents to do well in school, Anthony
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 59
was his high school valedictorian but admits he likely would not have had that drive had it not
been for his parents.
Anthony described a somewhat difficult high school experience which he noted he did
not enjoy. “It was pretty tough,” he recalled. While he wasn’t anti-social, per se, he didn’t have a
lot of close friends in his medium-sized high school and floated between different groups. He
reported, “I made some decent friends,” but “I didn’t hang out with people much outside of high
school.” Anthony described himself as “extremely overly judgmental” and someone who made
things a bigger deal than they were when he didn’t agree. Having been adopted, he always felt
that the people who were supposed to have cared for him instead abandoned him. Thus, he had
rather high expectations of relationships.
He graduated high school in 2021 after having been remote for two semesters and then
hybrid in his final semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the summer after he
graduated high school, his parents first floated the idea of Anthony taking a gap year before
starting college. It was actually his sister, a graduate of Yardley College, who made her parents
aware of Yardley’s Guardian Gap Year program. Remarking on why he took a gap year and
what he was trying to accomplish, Anthony placed that decision squarely on his parents: “I
wanted to go to college right away, but they didn’t think I was quite prepared for that.” His
parents viewed the program as a way he could learn and grow while also strengthening his
Christian faith. Anthony speculated that the program’s affiliation with Yardley College may have
made it seem more credible to his parents. Admittedly, his sister did pique his interest a bit with
the camp angle of the gap year program, but he really wanted to do something his family had
never done before, which is why he initially did not want to attend Yardley College.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 60
While Anthony had heard of people taking a gap year, he was generally pessimistic about
the idea. He viewed people who take gap years as lazy, and he believed he was ready to start
college. “I didn’t really see the point” of “spending money to go, like, not do college,” he said. In
general, his initial impressions of a gap year were not good, and he believed it would merely be a
setback to his college education. Since he was not a fan of the gap year in general, he did not
entertain an unstructured gap year. To him, if this structured program were a step backwards, an
unstructured program would have been even worse. He reluctantly gave in to his parents’ wishes,
noting that he didn’t have the financial means to do otherwise.
In the fall of 2021, Anthony embarked on an experience that was typical of Yardley’s
Guardian Gap Year but atypical in many ways of gap years in general. Like Guardians who came
before him and now after him, Anthony’s gap year was rooted in Christianity and personal and
spiritual growth by way of living, eating, working, and worshipping with a small cohort in the
middle of the woods of a small northern town. His group of 25 experienced all the hallmarks of
the program from a six-week tech fast, to backpacking trips and communal dinners, with each
experience rooted in the goal of spiritual growth.
Anthony shared that there wasn’t much outreach from Yardley College during his
program, and he could have benefited from more communication on things like majors, classes,
college clubs, and activities. He was provided with a Yardley email address and got to take an
overnight trip to campus. Additionally, Yardley professors would come up for some classes, but
there was not a stated assumption that participants would be attending Yardley College
Finding 1: Family’s Key Role
Family played a key role in Anthony’s decision to take a gap year. To say that Anthony’s
parents were a factor in his taking a gap year would be an understatement. As Anthony said, “It
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 61
was mostly my parents’ decision.” They clearly believed something was lacking in Anthony, and
having had a positive experience with Yardley College by way of their daughter, they were
confident that this program could help shape Anthony as a person. Speaking on his sister’s
experience, Anthony affirmed, “That was probably a big factor for them.” While Anthony’s
sister helped to soften him a bit on the idea during the period when he was having Zoom
meetings about the program and interacting with its leaders and potential participants, Anthony
remained reluctant until the end. It is safe to speculate that, had it not been for his parents,
Anthony would have gone straight from high school to college without interruption.
Finding 2: Self-Development Over Academics and Career
More so than preparing for his education and career endeavors, self-development was the
driving factor in Anthony’s decision to take a gap year. Anthony explained that his parents didn’t
think he was quite ready for college. Looking back, Anthony described himself as “very
immature” in high school and described a post-gap year Anthony as a more emotionally mature,
happier person who is more appreciative and content with life. Whereas the old Anthony came
off as perhaps a bit combative to those he didn’t agree with, the new Anthony is more openminded and appears to now have the tools to seek information and resolve conflict in a healthy
way.
Though selecting a major and career path did not directly drive Anthony in choosing the
gap year path, Anthony now recognizes the connection between self-development and his
ultimate career success, speculating that being more mature in how he approaches relationships
will likely benefit him in his future career workspace, as will critical thinking skills.
Finding 3: Gap Year Impact
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 62
The gap year was critical in preparing Anthony for college. In speaking with Anthony, it
is clear that he had a lot of emotional baggage after graduating high school, and he speculated
how not addressing that would have played out. Without the gap year, Anthony explained, “I
think I would have been a big mess.”
Pre-gap year, Anthony was guarded, and perhaps even a bit angry, over lingering feelings
of abandonment related to his having been placed for adoption; this had altered his understanding
of “healthy relationships.” He explained that the gap year showed him how to experience intense
friendship for the first time and taught him about having grace and forgiveness. As Anthony
explained his transformation, it was as if an invisible weight was being lifted off him.
Based on Anthony’s intelligence, one could argue that he would have been successful in
college even without this experience. Anthony himself, though, believes that had he gone
directly to college, it would have been a “horrible experience” and he would have “hated it.”
While Anthony had the intellectual ability to do well in college, it may be worthwhile to consider
some of the ancillary objectives of college, such as gaining independence, forming lasting
relationships, and graduating workforce ready, when one seeks to determine collegiate success.
When Anthony described his journey of personal growth and newly discovered openness to new
things, he considered those factors—which are indeed part of the college experience—and, in
this respect, the gap year may have put him ahead of the pack.
Finding 4: Faith
Faith and spiritual development were major components of Anthony’s gap year
experience. Arguably, there are many aspects of the Guardian Gap Year that fall outside the
boundaries of a typical gap year. A 24-hour food fast in which students sit in solitude in the
woods in order to reflect is one such unique aspect to this program. However, many of those
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 63
components are rooted in the objective of a spiritual evolution, and Anthony’s experience was no
exception. Reflecting on this, Anthony concluded that the “intensity and intentionality” of
various components of the program was “helpful to me and my faith.”
Finding 5: Limited Outreach by College
Outreach by Yardley College was somewhat limited during the gap year. Since Anthony
was initially opposed to taking a gap year, the program’s affiliation with a college and some forcredit courses was appealing to Anthony. However, it seemed the outreach by Yardley College
during the program was somewhat lacking in what may have benefited college-bound
participants. Anthony suggested that there could have been more communications about things
like majors, classes, and activities to get involved with at Yardley College.
Cecelia
Raised in a close military family, Cecelia moved around a lot as a child and was
homeschooled by her mother for most of her education. Her father’s military career took them to
many places, including overseas for a bit, but the family has been living in a small town about an
hour from a city on the southeast coast of the United States for nearly eight years. Cecelia is the
oldest of four siblings, with two younger sisters and one brother. “The most consistent people in
my life are the ones that moved with me,” she said. Active in high school, Cecelia had no
problems making friends and noted she had “lots of different social outlets” and was heavily
involved in orchestra. During her junior and senior years of high school, she dual-enrolled in a
local community college. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit during the spring of her junior year,
her family was more isolated than many because of her father’s job.
Cecelia was rather unsure about her next steps as she graduated high school. She had
little exposure to career paths and wasn’t even sure whether she wanted to go to college. She felt
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 64
she needed more time to make some of those big decisions, and she needed a break from the
academic rigor she had experienced in high school. Her father was a Yardley alum, and she felt
Yardley was a comfortable option. So, she applied to school there and nowhere else, still a little
unsure of her future plans. Cecelia was not familiar with structured gap years, but during the
Yardley application process, she clicked a button and learned of the Guardian Gap Year
Program. Intrigued by the idea, Cecelia took the lead in doing her own research. “I think the first
year you’re away from home is very influential to the kind of person you’re going to choose to
be,” she asserted. Spirituality was an important aspect of her gap year. She was most excited
about the equestrian track of the program, as she loves horses.
Though her parents didn’t know a lot about gap years and Cecelia was the one who
initially broached the idea, her family was supportive of her throughout the process, even sitting
in on several Zoom meetings about the program. They understood Cecelia’s anxiety about
jumping right into college without a real plan, and the family collectively agreed the gap year
would allow her to learn more about herself and what she wanted to pursue. Cecelia noted that
she had friends who had done gap years not specific to this program who had a “great, easy,
restful year experience” which appealed to her.
Though she was set on eventually going to college, for Cecelia, the gap year was more
about personal development than academics, though the program having an academic affiliation
was important to her. While she would have entertained a self-structured gap year, her parents
likely would not have financially supported something unstructured.
In the fall of 2021, Cecelia began a “lighthearted” and somewhat “adventurous” semester
typical of the communal style of the Guardian Gap Year Program, complete with wilderness
trips, working with horses in the barn, and the customary six week tech fast. From there, though,
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 65
the social dynamics of the group began to progressively deteriorate, and, in Cecelia’s opinion,
there were some unhealthy relationship dynamics which became “progressively worse.” With
little free time and few opportunities to connect with family, Cecelia struggled with the 24/7
nature of the program and desired personal space to be able to step away and regroup when
things got difficult. Cecelia was also hoping for a gap year where she could put academics to the
side and take a break, which is not the set-up of Guardian. There were many things, though, that
she really enjoyed about the experience, including her two-week excursion to Costa Rica to work
with children at a Boys & Girls Club to help them make friends and learn about Jesus. In her
barn time with the horses, she learned about “service as an act of worship.”
For Cecelia, outreach from Yardley College wasn’t really important to her during the gap
year because an academic connection really wasn’t a driving factor in her gap year decision.
During Guardian, Cecelia received a letter of encouragement from a current Yardley student, and
Yardley staff was available to her. However, attending Yardley was “really not pushed” other
than when the cohort spent a night at Yardley College to show participants Yardley was an
option. Cecelia thinks optional check-ins from Yardley during the gap year would have been
beneficial, as would having current students or professors connect throughout the gap year.
Cecelia expressed mixed feelings about her gap year experience. While her time with
horses inspired her love of working and helped her choose her major in psychology, her gap year
was very difficult due to some relationship struggles amongst people in the program and “ended
on quite a bad note.” She described a physically and mentally exhausting year that ultimately
helped her grow as a person, but she believes a different type of gap year would have been a
better choice for her. Traveling with a small group of people where she had a greater ability to
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 66
choose what she was doing is more in line with her idea of a gap year, and she would likely lean
against the Guardian Gap Year Program if she had to do things over.
Finding 1: Family’s Key Role
Family played a key role in Cecilia’s decision to take a gap year. While Cecelia first
introduced the gap year to her parents, her father’s affiliation with Yardley College is what led
her to apply there and eventually to the Guardian Gap Year Program. Her parents were generally
supportive of her decision to take a gap year but likely would not have financially supported
something that was self-structured. “I think they could empathize with my anxiety about starting
school,” she explained, and said, “All of us kind of agreed” that the gap year option was the way
to go. Her father’s experience as a Yardley College alum really helped her parents get
comfortable with the idea of the Guardian Gap Year Program. Additionally, her parents
“definitely did a lot of research” on the program before she made her decision.
Finding 2: Faith
Faith was an important factor in Cecelia deciding to do this particular gap year program.
“I wanted a place that would develop me spiritually,” she said. When it came to her faith, Cecelia
wanted to use the gap year as a means to self-discovery, independent of her parents, explaining
that self-development was the driving factor. She wanted to “know what [her] faith was separate
from theirs.” Throughout her gap year, faith and spirituality were never far removed from her
activities. For example, she spoke of a missionary trip to Costa Rica where she worked with a
Boys and Girls Club in a poor neighborhood where children could be fed and learn about Jesus.
Finding 3: Self-Development Over Academics and Career
Self-development, including spiritual development, was the driving factor for Cecilia in
deciding to take a gap year. It was believed that career identification would grow out of this
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 67
development: “The academic preparation part was not as important to me because I wasn’t sure
whether I would continue on to a university or not.” Cecelia wavered as to whether college was
in her future or not, though she did apply and was accepted to Yardley College. She was certain,
though, that her first year after high school would be important in shaping the kind of person she
would be, and she was particularly interested in exploring her faith independent of her parents.
Finding 4: Early Communications
Cecelia and her family would have benefited from a more realistic preview of the
Guardian Gap Year Program. Hoping for a break from the rigors of her high school academics,
Cecelia expressed that she wished she had better understood the intensity of the program prior to
making the decision to enroll, suggesting that Guardian participants might have helped with
those communications. Both she and her family seemed unprepared for the non-stop nature of
the program set-up and the difficulty in communicating with each other during the year. Cecilia
explained, “It is not a year off,” and “certainly not a vacation.” Cecelia believes her parents
would have been more hesitant for her to do the program had they better understood the intensity
of the program: “I think if they had a better depiction of how structured it was, or how busy I
would be, they probably would have been more hesitant.” She noted that rest is a “great thing”
but was not part of her gap year experience.
Scottie
Born on the East Coast but primarily raised in a Midwest college town, Scottie is an
identical twin whose sibling did the Yardley Guardian Gap Year along with him. His older
brother and sister-in-law are also Yardley College alumni. With a Yardley alum father who is a
college theology and Christianity professor and a mother who recently reentered the workforce
as an employee of Yardley College, Scottie had several unique connections to the sponsoring
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 68
institution. His father had roomed with the Guardian Gap Year Program Director in college, and
the tight-knit family periodically visited Yardley College for weekends, reunions, and the like.
Scottie described a very active high school experience, having excelled in sports, played
in orchestra, and kept a small circle of friends. The public school he attended was similar in size
to Yardley College and is atypical of Yardley students. He noted that many Yardley students
assume public schools are filled with “sex and drugs and stuff like that,” but that was not his
personal experience. Religion was a major influence in his high school life, and he described
how he tried to evangelize in school but was ultimately prevented from doing so because it was a
public school.
Scottie graduated high school in 2020, but his final semester was fully remote due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Though the educational pivot did disrupt some ceremonial aspects of his
senior year, he was actually pretty happy about the change and wasn’t as socially or emotionally
impacted by the lockdown as were some others. Having a twin meant he was never lonely, and
being a musician meant he had something to focus on while at home. He had enjoyed high
school but was ready to move on. Scottie’s parents first proposed the idea of doing the Guardian
program. Both Scottie and his brother, who grew up not terribly far from Yardley, as children
had attended the same camp where the Guardian program is located. Scottie wasn’t initially very
interested in doing a gap year because he was very academically focused and thought taking time
away from school would be a roadblock and that he would lose stamina for things like reading
and writing papers. His parents lobbied hard for both Scottie and his brother to take a gap year,
noting that the pandemic restrictions would hinder a typical freshman year experience.
While Scottie had some familiarity with taking a gap year because he had spent a period
of his childhood living in Europe where the gap year is a more common phenomenon, he was
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 69
generally skeptical about the idea for himself. He was eager to dive into the religious studies that
Yardley College would allow him to explore, but his parents were very influenced by Guardian’s
connection to Yardley and felt that it would allow Scottie to go into the Yardley experience with
a community already established.
Having already been accepted to Yardley College, Scottie did not entertain an
unstructured gap year. To him, the structured program that would transition smoothly into his
college experience was very important, and having his “foot in the door” academically was
appealing. However, a gap year that produced a career path wasn’t all that important to him.
Scottie recounted his father often telling him, “You have the privilege of going to college, not
necessarily to get a job but like to learn.” He noted that, because his parents supported him
financially, he would not have done something that they didn’t support, but ultimately, the final
decision was his.
In the fall of 2020, as the world was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and a
divisive presidential election, Scottie began his gap year experience in a cohort of 25 participants
who were largely shielded from the day-to-day news. Like other Yardley Guardian Gap Year
participants, Scottie’s year followed the blueprint of personal and spiritual growth through a
structured world of living, eating, working, and worshipping together. His experience with his
cohort of 25 in a camp-like setting was during the height of COVID-19 concerns but still adhered
to the basic structure of the program from a six-week tech fast to camping trips and dorm-style
living, with Christian values guiding the process.
Scottie described a fair number of interactions with Yardley College during his program,
such as having a Yardley email address, conversations with admissions counselors at Yardley on
things like core scheduling, and Yardley professors teaching some classes. Additional outreach
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 70
such as “some sort of crash course in the day of a life of” a Yardley student would have been
beneficial to him.
Finding 1: Family’s Key Role
Family played a key role in Scottie’s decision to take a gap year. Discussing his parents’
wishes for both he and his brother to participate in the gap year program, Scottie quipped, “They
wanted us to do it more than we initially wanted to do it.” Scottie was very set on going to
college after he graduated high school. Since Scottie’s father had a close relationship with the
head of Yardley’s gap year program, and COVID-19 restrictions were certain to impact his
freshman year if he went straight to college, his family really tried to convince both Scottie and
his brother that a gap year was the way to go.
Finding 2: Faith
Faith and spiritual development were a major component of Scottie’s life in general and,
thus, closely intertwined with his gap year experience. Heading into the gap year, spiritual
growth and formation were at the forefront of Scottie’s life as he contemplated his future. “I was
very much set on biblical and theological studies,” he explained. At the time he was making this
decision, Scottie was trying to decide about whether to enter the priesthood. While he has since
decided against the priesthood, he remains committed to faith but approaches people a bit
differently. He explained, “I had to learn to kind of deconstruct the language by which I reveal
my beliefs and opinions about things, and I think that actually made me care less about my
beliefs and opinions and be a lot more open-minded.” He noted that he used to try to show other
students that he knew more about the subject of theology than they did, and he now takes a
“more gracious” approach.
Finding 3: Gap Year Impact
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 71
The gap year gave Scottie skills necessary for college and adulthood. Scottie’s gap year
transformation might be characterized by the fact that he didn’t know what he didn’t know about
himself. He thought he was emotionally prepared for the next step in his life, and, like many
teenagers, he thought he had all the answers. He described a very idealized view of what his
educational path would look like as he was making the decision to embrace a gap year.
Prior to taking the gap year, Scottie described himself as an “over-reactive contrarian”
who often fought people on his faith and got caught up in very conservative leanings. He was
emotionally closed off to people and didn’t want to overshare or appear to be too vulnerable.
During the gap year, he learned to be more gracious, and he credits his close relationship with
two females in the program for opening up another side of him. He noted that the gap year
“softened [him]” and “let [him] interact with people who thought a lot differently than [him].”
He said, the gap year “provided me with some of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had.”
Prior to some of the very intense activities of the program, such as spending 24 hours
solo in a torrential downpour, Scottie seemed to believe his world was everyone’s reality.
Looking back, he described himself as an “upper middle class White dude” who took certain
comforts and material possessions for granted. The gap year changed all that, and experiences
like the 24-hour fast alone in the woods in a storm helped him develop “a certain level of
grittiness” and better prepared him for a “plethora of situations.” By working with his hands,
taking time to reflect, and keeping a journal, Scottie now has a very mature and even-keeled
demeanor that was evident in his interactions with the researcher.
The experience also gave him some more practical skills, like learning to write and
communicate with more brevity, getting a sense of a college class load, and learning to receive
feedback. He learned how to get his point across.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 72
Finding 4: School Affiliation
The gap year affiliation with his school was important to Scottie. Since he was very
academically focused, keeping his foot in the door academically during the gap year was
important to him. He noted that the affiliation with his college was “pretty critical” for his
decision, and he doesn’t believe he would have entertained a gap year that did not include that
component. Having already been accepted to Yardley College at the time he made the decision to
do a gap year, it seemed as though it was an easier sell from his parents because he would still be
earning some credits toward eventually entering Yardley College.
Jim
Raised in Indonesia, Jim had a very multi-cultural upbringing. His American mother and
Australian father, who met in seminary in the United States, are both educational consultants
overseas. He has an older brother who also moved to the United States to attend Yardley
College.
With a life and family deeply influenced by faith, Jim attended a small international
Christian school from third grade through high school where he described having had “a pretty
good social sphere.” The school, which houses pre-K through 12th grade, had just about 250
students, with only 10 in his graduating class. Jim described a very active high school experience
filled with involvement in sports, drama, and student government. He was social in high school
and described himself as a “pretty good student” who ranked toward the top of his class in most
subjects.
He graduated high school in 2019, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
began his gap year in the fall of 2019. His parents first presented the idea of a gap year as an
option. Having watched their older son struggle with the transition to attending college in a new
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 73
country, they believed that taking a gap year would help with Jim’s cultural adjustments and
allow him to “have an experience that would actually be beneficial to [him] for later years.”
They were strong believers in a good education and thought Jim could benefit from having seen
the struggles of his brother.
While Jim believes he had likely heard of people taking a gap year, he never seriously
contemplated a gap year until his parents told him they had been doing research on the idea.
Structured gap years are not common in Indonesia. His parents had been researching gap years in
general and, when it became clear that Jim wanted to go to Yardley College, the Guardian Gap
Year Program just made sense. He initially wasn’t sure about the idea of a gap year, but he “took
hold of the idea pretty quickly” after some additional research to find out more. While they
wanted the decision to be his own, Jim tends to follow his parents’ advice and, since some
trusted family and friends reassured them that the gap year was a legitimate option, he decided to
go that route.
In the fall of 2019, Jim began his gap year experience in a small cohort of 12 and, with
the exception of a few activities that were cut short in the spring of 2020 due to the pandemic,
experienced a typical Guardian Gap Year. He spent six weeks doing construction work, six
weeks in equestrian work, and was beginning his six weeks of office work when the onset of
COVID-19 lockdowns led to rushed farewells and a shortened spring session.
As was typical of Yardley’s Guardian Gap Year, Jim’s year encompassed living, eating,
working, and worshipping with his cohort, while also embracing some bigger adventures,
including a two-week missionary trip to Costa Rica. Jim explained his belief that people get out
of the program what they put into it, and he wanted to get a lot out of it.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 74
Jim, who was accepted to Yardley College and deferred, shared that the gap year faculty
did communicate important college dates and tasks that needed to be done but were not overly
pushy in promoting Yardley College, which was somewhat surprising to him though not a
problem. Jim expressed that a bit more communication about what the Yardley experience would
look like and perhaps some integration pointers and tutorials on how to register for class would
have been helpful.
While he acknowledged that there were challenges that may have made the experience a
bit less, overall, the gap year was a very important time in his life to “learn more about who I am
and my personal and spiritual callings.” He also described it as very useful in helping him adapt
to life in the United States and in “preparing for a new season of life that would look very
different.”
Finding 1: Family’s Key Role
Family played a key role in Jim’s decision to take a gap year. Jim’s parents watched their
older son struggle with the transition of moving to the United States to directly attend Yardley
College and believed a gap year would be a good way to aid Jim in that adjustment. Jim shared,
“They definitely were pushing me to learn from the experience of my older brother who had
struggled with some cultural adjustment.” While Jim quickly warmed up to the idea, he
acknowledged that he typically follows the advice of his parents. It is unlikely Jim would have
pursued a gap year had it not been for the encouragement of his family: “They didn’t want [Jim]
to struggle with” what his brother had gone through and “definitely wanted something that would
. . . further [his] development as a person.” The process of researching the gap year in general, as
well as this specific program, was really a family endeavor, as Jim was “looking at this alongside
[his] parents” and they were “researching together.”
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 75
Finding 2: Self-Development Over Academics and Career
More so than preparing for his education and career endeavors, self-development was the
driving factor in Jim’s decision to take a gap year. Jim embarked on a gap year with the hopes
that there would be a lot of self-reflection so that he could figure out his path in life and the kind
of person he wanted to be. Academics and his eventual career path really took a backseat, as he
sought to take a breather from his intense high school academic pressures and “reorient” and
“figure out more about [him]self.” He recalled that he was “more interested in the formation side
of things above the academical [sic] side.”
For his parents, learning how to live in a new country and have an easier time going into
college was really the main reason they pushed their son toward a gap year. While Jim learned
skills that would ultimately be helpful in his education and career, such as time management and
responsibility, the gap year was really more about his development as a person.
Finding 3: Faith
Faith and spiritual development were major components of Jim’s gap year experience. A
key reason Jim decided on taking a gap year was not only to determine who he wanted to be as a
person, but also “within that [year, to] look at vocation from a Christian perspective.” While
some aspects of the Guardian Gap Year may seem unconventional, and the majority of time was
not spent on anything academic, faith and spiritual development is at the heart of many of the
program’s activities. As Jim contemplates his long-term plans, he plans to go wherever "God is
calling [him] to go."
Discussion
Common Theme 1: Family’s Key Role
Synthesis of Findings
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 76
To varying degrees, family played a key role in the gap year decision. In the most
extreme case, Anthony initially saw no upside at all in the gap year option. He was adamant that
taking a gap year would set back his education and, without his parents pushing, it is clear that a
gap year would not have been in his future. He said, “My parents were familiar with the
advantages, and I was more familiar with the disadvantages.” Like Anthony, Scottie also was
initially against taking a gap year and he, too, felt he was emotionally ready to go to college.
Scottie’s parents also worked to persuade both him and his twin brother that the gap year was the
right decision, particularly in light of the impact COVID-19 restrictions would have on their
college experience. While it didn’t take Jim quite as long to warm up to the idea, it was also his
parents who initially introduced the gap year to him. Jim acknowledged that he generally
“follows their advice most of the time,” and this was no exception. Cecelia was the only
participant who actually brought the gap year forward to her parents, but even in her situation,
her parents were integral in the process.
Parents acted as important partners to their children in the gap year journey. During the
initial research phase, the parents of all participants were active in learning about the pros and
cons of gap years and the Guardian Gap Year Program, in particular. They did online research,
sat in on Zoom calls, talked to administrators, and generally acted in a consultative capacity to
their children on this issue.
Connections to the Literature
While it may initially seem unusual that parents in this study were so integral in the
decision to take a gap year, research suggests that this is not atypical of how many aspects of the
college selection process play out. A study on community college enrollment, for example, found
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 77
that three out of five parents reported that the idea for their child to attend community college
was first introduced by them (Bers & Galowich, 2002).
In the early 2000’s, as online platforms became more ubiquitous and tuition rates
continued to soar, even colleges began to acknowledge the critical role of parents in the college
decision process and, in turn, began to do more purposeful outreach to involve them. By 2005,
nearly half of all colleges had online resources targeted at parents, with some even offering
college tours for parents (Stein, 2006). Today, as Zoom and other online tools have made
accessibility and research easier than ever, parental involvement continues to expand. Therefore,
when examining the role that these parents played in their child’s decision to take a gap year, it is
not surprising that they acted in close collaboration with their children.
Involvement of these parents was not a sudden onset but rather one more step in their
children’s educational journey. It was clear in speaking with the participants that their parents
had long been involved in their academic success, and their decision to take a gap year was no
exception. Research suggests that students’ self-determination about college readiness is
positively impacted when parents are involved in college planning, and students often point to
their parents as the top motivational factor in the college decision-making process (Mitchall &
Jaeger, 2018).
Common Theme 2: Self-Development Over Academics and Career
Synthesis of Findings
For each of the participants, self-development was the key driving factor in taking a gap
year and carried more weight than identifying a major or career path. Anthony and Scottie both
recognized in hindsight that they lacked a certain level of maturity heading into college, and their
parents saw the gap year as a way to really develop them as people. Jim’s situation was quite
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 78
unique, as he was moving to a new country. Nonetheless, his parents also saw the gap year as a
way for him to grow as a person and acclimate himself to life in the United States by taking a
year to develop some additional life skills. Both Jim and Claire viewed the gap year as a way to
determine the kind of person they would be in the next phase of life.
One notable item related to personal development is the role that faith and spirituality
played in this particular program. Each of the study participants comes from a religious family
and, when the participants spoke of personal development, it was almost synonymous with
spiritual development. Every participant discussed in detail their faith and its importance to them
with discussing their experiences in relation to the gap year.
Connections to the Literature
The gap year is often framed as a unique opportunity to do something worthwhile and to
“engage in individualized, reflexive, identity work” (Snee, 2014, p. 843).
For these participants, identity work often involved spiritual exploration. It turns out that
exploring one’s faith is a fairly common reason for taking a gap year, and many gap year
programs exist that are specifically dedicated to promoting Christian values. According to the
website for CMTS Ministries (n.d.), a Christian gap year is a way for participants to identify
what it is that God wants them to do with their life. The participants in this study echoed very
similar sentiments, with Cecelia, for example, stating that she was looking for a place where she
could determine what her faith was outside of her parents. Likewise, Jim planned to go wherever
God was calling him and indicated the gap year was a vehicle by which to do that.
While some parents may have been concerned about how a gap year would impact
academic and career motivations, research shows that completing a gap year is actually a
positive predictor of academic motivation (Martin, 2010). The parents of these participants
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 79
seemed to buy into that notion, or at least were willing to take that gamble in exchange for the
expected personal development and maturity of their children.
Common Theme 3: School Affiliation
Synthesis of Findings
In exploring the role of outreach and education with students and parents throughout the
gap year process, one unusual phenomenon was uncovered. Students and families were already
very familiar with Yardley College and, while they may not have been educated on the Guardian
Gap Year Program in particular, their strong positive ties to Yardley College were apparent.
In addition to each of these students having had some member of their family already
attend Yardley College, there were other very personal connections. Scottie’s father, for instance,
was the roommate of the Guardian Gap Year Program Director in college, and the family
periodically visited Yardley College for weekends, reunions, and the like during Scottie’s
childhood. While these participants didn’t cite affiliation with Yardley College as the main
reason for choosing this particular gap year program, they acknowledge that the relationship
likely gave their parents added ease with this option.
Connections to the Literature
While the students themselves weren’t overly swayed by the Guardian Gap Year
Program’s affiliation with Yardley College, they did acknowledge that it may have been more
influential in shaping their parents’ perceptions. This is understandable because, for many
college admissions counselors, the credibility of a gap year can vary widely from program to
program, and it is important to know whether the college a student is ultimately pursuing
supports the gap year (Claybourn, 2022). Since these students were all at least loosely planning
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 80
to attend Yardley College, it is understandable that their parents would feel a sense of ease that
their chosen gap year program was affiliated with the school.
Common Theme 4: Outreach
Synthesis of Findings
A common description from students about the communications from Yardley College
throughout the Guardian program was that Yardley was neither pushed to students nor was there
an assumption that participants would be ultimately enrolling in Yardley College. In fact,
participants reported that most Guardian participants do not ultimately go to Yardley.
Nonetheless, students did gain some exposure to Yardley during the gap year. This included
being provided with a Yardley email address, taking an overnight trip to the Yardley campus,
and meeting professors who came to the Guardian program to guest lecture or teach.
Speaking as students who did ultimately enroll in Yardley College, several suggestions
were offered about how to improve communications throughout the gap year program. They
included optional check-ins from the college, information about majors, clubs, activities, etc. at
Yardley, a day-in-the-life of a typical student, and helpful hints on course enrollment.
Connections to the Literature
When exploring the ongoing outreach by Yardley College during the gap year, even
though the parents already had strong ties to the school, it is important to recognize the desire by
parents to be continually educated on issues impacting their children’s education. Particularly
when focusing on Gen Z students, parents are not only concerned about the value of college but
also want to be educated in a variety of areas, such as their child’s mental health and safety,
diversity on campus, and career and professional considerations (Brock, 2022). With this in
mind, more robust communication throughout the gap year about next steps could have been
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 81
beneficial to both the students and their families. Parental involvement, coupled with a
partnership with the school, has been shown to create a mindset amongst students to focus on
attaining college-specific milestones (George Mwangi et al., 2019). Further, the process of offboarding from a gap year is one that parents need to fully understand. Harvard University, which
is recognized as an institution that strongly advocates for students to take a gap year, has a robust
alumni network—the Harvard Gap Year Society—dedicated to transitioning and supporting gap
year students (Knight, 2018).
Research Question: How could a formal approach to the gap year option influence students’
perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between high school and
community college? To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions
were examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and family
members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and disadvantages)?
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when the gap year choice includes
a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and career endeavors?
3. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced when keeping them on task to
ultimately enroll in college is a component of the gap year?
Synthesis of Common Themes
The findings offer various insights into how a formal approach to the gap year option
could influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option between
high school and community college. First, the study highlights the critical nature of early and
frequent communications with parents, as they not only play a major role in guiding their
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 82
children’s college plans but also were positively impacted by experiences with the sponsoring
college of the gap year program.
Second, understanding the driving force behind why a child and/or their parents may be
pursuing a gap year can help ensure that communications are tailored appropriately. In this study,
for example, students and their parents were more interested in the gap year as a means of selfdevelopment as opposed to attempting to identify a major and/or career path. Therefore,
structured offerings tailored toward personal development—in this case also spiritual
development—were important in positioning the gap year as a credible and viable option after
high school.
Third, while the school’s affiliation with this particular gap year program may not have
been the deciding factor for students, it likely was an important supporting factor for parents. In
fact, all of these families had prior positive ties with Yardley College independent of the gap
year. Therefore, it stands to reason that involvement with the school helped shape parental
attitudes and perceptions.
Finally, while the school had some positive interactions with students throughout the gap
year, the school could have done more in terms of ongoing outreach. If a community college, for
example, were attempting to develop a structure around supporting gap year students, participant
feedback could offer some concrete suggestions. In this study, students suggested optional
check-ins from the college, information about majors, clubs, activities, etc. at Yardley College, a
day-in-the-life of a typical student, and helpful hints on course enrollment.
Chapter 4 Summary
This chapter reported the findings of two semi-structured qualitative interviews
conducted during the fall of 2023 with each of four study participants. The interviews explored
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 83
the individual perceptions and attitudes of the participants about their personal gap year
experience. Chapter 5 concludes the study’s final report by discussing implications for practice
and offering recommendations for future research.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION
Chapter 5 Introduction
Research Purpose
This chapter answers the study’s main research question and three sub-questions,
explores implications for practice, discusses limitations of the study, offers suggestions for future
research, and ends with a conclusion which provides the researcher’s final thoughts on the study.
The purpose of this study was to explore factors that influence students’ perceptions and
attitudes about the gap year choice so that institution administrators (of UCC and other
community colleges) can better understand how to structure and present it as a viable educational
option.
Research Questions and Answers
This study explored the following research question: How could a formal approach to the
gap year option influence students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable
option between high school and community college?
To aid in answering the research question, the following three sub-questions were
examined:
1. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes influenced by educating students and
family members on the gap year option (including its potential advantages and
disadvantages)?
It was evident throughout this process that the attitudes and perceptions of family
members—especially parents—concerning the gap year played a key role in shaping student
perceptions. Interestingly, in the case of three of the four participants, parents initially introduced
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 85
the idea of taking a gap year. Though the fourth participant initiated exploration of a gap year,
her parents still played a critical role in that decision.
As the researcher explored the sub-question of how students’ perceptions and attitudes
were influenced by educating students and family members on the gap year option (including its
potential advantages and disadvantages), it became increasingly evident that the students and
parents approached educating themselves about the gap year option as a family pursuit. Whether
by participating in Zoom calls, conducting research online, or speaking to program
representatives, the family units were very involved in proactively educating themselves about
the gap year option. Since the students all displayed close connections to their families, parental
influence played a pivotal role in shaping the perception of the gap year option to their children,
even for those students who were initially hesitant about the idea.
One unexpected dynamic that surfaced during the research was that the parents of all four
participants had prior positive experiences with Yardley College, whether it was through
relationships with program administrators, a degree from the school, and/or other children who
had attended the school. This was significant because the school itself already had a built-in level
of credibility to these parents. Instead of seeking out information about the sponsoring school’s
legitimacy, the parents and their children could remain focused specifically on the gap year
program.
2. How are students’ perceptions and attitudes impacted when the gap year choice
includes a structured path aimed at better preparing students for educational and
career endeavors?
The biggest surprise in the findings was in exploring how students’ perceptions and
attitudes were influenced when the gap year choice included a structured path aimed at better
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 86
preparing students for educational and career endeavors. While the experience did, ultimately,
lend itself toward helping to shape majors and career paths for this group, participants didn’t
initially place much emphasis on whether the gap year contained a structured path regarding their
educational and career endeavors. Instead, both students and parents almost entirely homed in on
the spiritual and personal development side of the program versus the academic and career
components. Since these students and families prioritized personal growth, maturity, and
spiritual development of the participants, the structure surrounding the self-actualization aspects
of the program had the greatest influence on their overall attitudes and perceptions of the gap
year program.
3. How does a plan to engage in ongoing outreach to students during the gap year
affect students’ perceptions and attitudes toward a gap year?
When analyzing how students’ perceptions and attitudes were influenced when keeping
them on task to ultimately enroll in college as a component of the gap year, two themes emerged.
First, many program participants do not ultimately enroll in Yardley College or even any college.
Therefore, keeping them on track for ultimate enrollment was not nearly as prominent in the
program as was anticipated. Second, for those students who did ultimately attend Yardley
College, communication about basic aspects of the school appeared to be somewhat deficient.
Study participants made several suggestions as to what could have been beneficial, including
more communication about Yardley’s academic majors, clubs, course scheduling, and typical
student experiences.
The guiding research question of this study pondered how a formal approach to the gap
year option influences students’ perceptions and attitudes about the gap year as a viable option
between high school and community college. These case studies supported the important role
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 87
that a gap year program affiliated with a school can have on attitudes and perceptions. This
program, in particular, had the added benefit of being affiliated with the particular school the
students ultimately planned to attend. While the students themselves provided mixed feedback
about how the school’s formal approach and involvement with the gap year program impacted
their perceptions and attitudes, the option of a structured, school-affiliated gap year program was
much stronger in influencing parental attitudes and perceptions.
Implications for Practice
While dropping this exact gap year program into UCC will not lead to the desired
outcome of democratizing the gap year option and expanding access to this particular path, the
findings do offer a loose roadmap of what may or may not work in a public, community college
setting. Foremost, one of the key takeaways from the study was the important role families play
in the gap year decision. Therefore, involving parents early on in the research phase of such a
program at UCC and in the communication rollout would be key in structuring and presenting it
as a viable educational option. This would need to include both the advantages, such as personal
growth, career exploration, and recovery from academic burnout, and the disadvantages, such as
disrupting academic momentum, and financial implications of this option. Additionally, further
exploration of the relationship between student demographics—primarily socioeconomic
status—and access or success in a gap year program might need to be addressed in the creation
of such a program. Students attending a community college, for example, may be more impacted
by financial considerations than those students who have the means to attend a private, more
expensive college. Implications such as the relationship between taking a gap year and its impact
on financial aid and scholarships would need to be considered.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 88
The study also highlights that understanding student motivations in pursuing a gap year is
key. While the participants sought to use the gap year as a personal development tool
(particularly from a spirituality perspective) and placed less emphasis on major and career
exploration, tailoring some tracks to those desires would arguably lead to outcomes more aligned
with individual participant expectations.
Finally, one component of this program that may need to be retooled by UCC would be
adding components to keep students on track to ultimately enroll in a UCC program post gap
year and to ensure that the gap year is intentional and instrumental in advancing a student’s
educational and career path. While the Yardley gap year program did not prioritize students
ultimately enrolling in its institution, presumably UCC would likely want its gap year students to
attend the school. The primary shortfall in the existing model appears to be related to
communication and outreach while during the months when students are active participants in
the gap year program. This would likely need to be an area which UCC would need to make a
priority at the onset.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 89
Limitations
The goal of action research, which utilizes methods such as interviews, is to prompt some
form of intervention and improve a real-world situation (Godfrey, 2020; Herr & Anderson,
2015), but the lack of community college settings directly involved with structured gap year
programs led the researcher to focus on gap year participants in a program affiliated with a fouryear college versus a community college. Therefore, one limitation of this study is that some
level of generalizability is necessary for its findings to be meaningful. While this is slightly
outside of the norm of action research, the researcher believes that the study’s findings will serve
as a catalyst for making a change at the community college in question.
As with case studies in general, the small sample size, potential researcher bias, and the
possibility of untrue or skewed information reported by participants (Kekeya, 2021), need to be
considered as potential limitations. Additionally, this study was intended to be an example of
critical action research, which reflects an underlying commitment to ensuring fair and equitable
educational opportunities for all (Mertler, 2020). By democratizing the gap year option at the
community college level, students attending community college would have access to an
academic path that may be beneficial to them.
This study did not factor in the economic circumstances of the participants and their
families as compared with the financial status of community college students, which is an
additional limitation. One may assert that students attending a private four-year college may not
share the socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of many community colleges
and, therefore, findings may not be easily transferable to a community college setting and
population.
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 90
Perhaps the most significant limitation that came as a surprise to the researcher was that
faith and spirituality were, arguably, the driving force behind student and parental attitudes and
perceptions about this particular program. As a faith-based college, it was known upfront that
Christian values were embedded in the program. However, the intense spotlight on religion
certainly makes this exact prototype difficult to mimic in a public school setting.
Suggestions for Future Research
Since research on this topic is scarce, there is a strong argument to be made for future
studies. While there is a pool of research on the benefits of opting for a gap year, the existing
research does not extend to community college students specifically and does not focus on
structured, school-sponsored programs. Conducting research with students, their families, and
community college personnel via surveys, questionnaires, and focus groups on their perceptions
and attitudes about gap years may provide foundational data by which subsequent studies can be
developed.
Future studies that dive deeper into the demographics of the populations in question may
also help to ensure findings can be generalizable to a community college setting. Specifically,
factoring for socioeconomic differences and exploring challenges and obstacles that may surface
as a result of specific socioeconomic and/or demographic conditions may help foster the primary
goal of creating greater access for all students to this educational path.
Since the institution in this study had limited involvement in keeping students on track to
ultimately attend college, future studies that examine programs with more formal counseling
during the gap year process may be beneficial. Examining student and parental attitudes and
perceptions of other gap year programs with more robust academic and career components may
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 91
provide additional guidance to other entities who seek to develop gap year programs, particularly
public institutions that are not rooted in faith-based programs.
Chapter 5 Summary/Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to explore factors that influence students’ perceptions and
attitudes about the gap year choice so that the institution administrators (of UCC and other
community colleges) can better understand how to structure and present it as a viable educational
option.
The findings of this study align with the notion that, at least for some students, the gap
year experience can be a beneficial path for a variety of reasons. Therefore, access for students
from all backgrounds and walks of life should be prioritized. One way to democratize the gap
year, still sometimes associated with elite pockets of society, is to introduce this option at the
community college level. While the program explored in this study chose a very specific and
deeply intensive involvement in the actual gap year by having participants physically house
together throughout the program, UCC can certainly take elements of the program without
replicating it to that level.
Introducing a gap year option that comprehensively communicates the key considerations
of choosing the path to all relevant stakeholders including parents, recognizes and aligns with the
personal and highly individualized reasons students pursue a gap year, and ensures the gap year
is a component of the overall educational plan of the student, can help UCC promote greater
equity and opportunity across its student population. Further, the introduction of a gap year
option may offer ancillary benefits not entertained in this research, such as higher enrollment and
persistence rates. In short, as community colleges continue to evolve and retool, supporting a
DEMOCRATIZING THE GAP YEAR OPTION 92
well-constructed gap year option will be yet another opportunity to promote a student-centered
learning experience.
